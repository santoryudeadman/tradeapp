start i have been trading for about a decade i have been liquidated profitable bankrupt several times here are the rules that you must follow to survive in the market long term learn from history or perish here are my best trading lessons how much to invest dont invest at the cost of ruining your life your investment should always be an almost insignificant amount if you lose it it should hurt a bit but not ruin your life dont go all in ever dont invest more than you can afford to lose trade spot then futures practice a lot before trading watch live charts draw your levels then paper trade

long term without following the two tools of capital preservation i stop loss ii risk management both these tools are far more complicated than they sound read understand and only then trade dont be a hero to fight the trend dont try making quick trades by fighting the trend use the weekly time frame and the day moving average to find the trend and trade only in the direction of the market no good assets there are no good and bad assets dont get attached to a coin or a stock your aim is to make profits to buy low and sell high follow emperorbtc keep your logics attachments and emotions away and trade the chart eg cardano is shit but i made good money there exit at the first sight of bearishness dont pray for a trade to go right dont hope your aim is to leave the market asap once the trade goes the opposite direction dont give control to the market and keep hoping exit start afresh cut your losses keep them small plan dont trade if you dont have a planned entry exit and invalidation point listening to opinions of others will always get you rekt dont even listen to me you have to plan your entry position size and invalidation points its simple yet most difficult trading is easy you dont need complicated tools and monitors my mentor still trades with sr lines volume on his laptop the catch is you need a plan manage position size predetermined entries exit on invalidation cut losses trade more when learning trade a lot a lot trade with the trend as many times a possible your methods need real market testing trade more let the market give you feedback as much as possible the only way to get better at freethrows is to keep practicing learn learn learn trading is the most rewarding profession ever you cant expect it to be easy journalise all trade take notes and keep learning i have made tutorials for all topics here it works its free follow emperorbtc these are some of the rules off of my head that you must follow please dont try to fight them its better to learn from others mistakes than commit them you can scroll through my twitter and telegram to find all the tutorials it will take some efforts but its worth it follow emperorbtc introduction to technical analysis trading bitcoin masterclass part introduction in the next few days we are going to learn to trade bitcoin for profits i will keep in mind to keep it as short as possible making it completely comprehensible for extreme beginners terminology before you learn to trade we must know the true meaning of a few terms i have written down the most important terms and tried to explain them in the simplest manner possible if youre a new trader please go through them people who already trade can refresh their understanding where can i see the charts there are several websites i use tradingviewcom simple easy and offers everything most people need you don’t need a paid version the basic free version is enough bitcoin million satoshis million bits exchange in terms of crypto a marketplace which allows buying and selling of bitcoin or other coins egbybitbitmex fomo fear of missing out a trade all beginners do it they enter a trade without enough research in the fear of missing out profits total supply the amount limit of coins that will ever exist supply limit of bitcoin is million bull is someone expecting the price to go higher and bear is the opposite follow emperorbtc bull market a market where the prices are seeing a continuous uptrend leading to new highs being created generally happens when new investors enter the market bear market a period where the prices are seeing a long term down trend leading to a sell off see the chart below note a bull market can have many bearish cycles and vise versa as shown below market cap the market capitalisation of an asset calculated by current supply of coins multiplied by cmp of one coin follow emperorbtc bubble a situation where the prices are irrationally high as compared to the actual value of the asset whole of an asset could be a bubble or a market cycle could be a bubble eg theranos as an assetcompany was a bubble fud fear uncertainty and doubt day trading taking a position in the market either buy or sell and exiting it the same day eg mcafee announcing in that binance had been hacked was a fud swing trading this method looks for buying and selling positions in a weekly range swing traders make my traders a week most of my trades are swing trades positional trading the aim is to buy monthly lows and hold them for days weeks or sometimes months this is a longer term trading time period day trading taking a position in the market either buy or sell and exiting it the same day leverage refers to the extra amount of asset bought or sold over your capital limit eg if you buy of bitcoin with a capital of you have a leverage of sites like bitmex allow leverage as per your choice margin the amount of funds required to open a leveraged trade eg if you want to open a position of with a leverage of your margin requirement would be x long position this is a buy position buy with leverage eg if you have as capital you could buy worth of bitcoin with leverage or even more both profit and loss in this case is multiplied by the leverage you take eg a risefall in price in case of a long position with leverage will lead to profit or loss short position exact opposite of long entry you enter a short entry when you expect the prices to fall shorting allows you to make money in a bear market volatility it is the percentage movement in price of an asset over a period a balanced volatile asset gives ample opportunity to short and long traders look for predictable volatility a very highly volatile or low volatile assets isnt considered good for trading follow emperorbtc roe returnonequity this is calculated by the actual capital employed in a trade and not through leverage ohlc open high low and close altcoin all coins except bitcoin bull trap a technique used by market makers to buy a huge amount suddenly spiking the price this makes everyone else that this is a breakout and everyone buys they market makers then sell enormous amounts pushing the prices down in turn liquidation everyone else that had bought producing a cascading effect of liquidations bear trap is just the opposite of the above for making the prices go higher in the end askbid sell orders are asks and buy orders are bids spreadthe difference between what the sellers are ready to sell at and what the buyers are ready to buy at there always exists a small spread on all exchange the higher the liquidity the lower the spread eg in the below situation the spread is dollars see pic below of an order book explaining the above terms follow emperorbtc support and resistance a support is a zoneline where we can expect the price to bounce back up resistance is a linezone where we can expect the price to rebound downwards we will study this in the next lessons walls extremely large orders at a range demand zone a zone with huge buy orders this is determined through the heat map supply zone a zone with huge sell orders this is determined through the heat map stoploss order that is triggered when the price goes below this point used to cut losses supportresistance liquidity the measure of how actively the coin is being traded in the market a high liquidity coinexchange has many buyers and sellers at the same time making it easier to acquire or sell the coin at any time uptrend a price is said to be in an uptrend when its making higher highs and higher lows it can be confined in a channel channel uptrend and higher high and higher lows are shown in the chart below the chart below showcases an uptrend an uptrend channel and higher highs and higher lows downtrendopposite of uptrend the prices here make lower highs and lower lows consolidation a period where the price is ranging in a welldefined region this is a period of indecision and generally leads to a volatile movement in either directions correction a correction is a fall in price after making a new peak or an upwards rally many authors define the correction as drop from all time high but its arbitrary follow emperorbtc sideways market an indecisive market which isnt leading to a breakdown or a breakout and not giving any signals in either way sell off profit taking after a rally in price which leads to lowering of price of the asset rally an upward trend leading to increase in price of the asset can happen in both bear and bull market accumulation the process by which one builds a position in an asset pattern a chart pattern is a predefined shape that have been historically studied by technicians traders try to use these previous performance statistics to predict future price movements eg a head and shoulders top is considered bearish there are many such pattern which will be fractal a pattern of price movement which has occurred earlier and might occur again limit order order will execute at a predefined price if the market riches that price market order an order to buy or sell at the current price level executed immediately time period time frame the time spread of each candle stick in a chart common time periods are min hour daily and so on ath alltime highs prices average down trying to lower the average entry cost of a position by slowly buying the asset at reducing rates liquidationwhen you are stopped out of your position because the trade went in the opposite direction and your margins are not big enough to carry the trade anymore arbitrage a method of making profit using the pricing difference between exchanges eg if bitcoin is trading at on bitstamp and on bitfinex people will buy from bitstamp and sell on bitfinex follow emperorbtc premise of technical analysis now that weve completely understood a few important trading jargons lets begin with technical analysis technical analysis is the use of charting techniques to predict future price movement it uses previous human reactions to a similar situation to predict future price movements only price movement it taken into consideration while using technical analysis all other information like news earnings is not taken into consideration it might come as a surprise to all new traders that news is disregarded while studying charts murphy in his book on technical analysis explains in detail why it is so to keep it short the price discounts everything market price of an asset already has taken into consideration all the fundamental news news information and other analysis available in the public already have affected the price and hence the price is an amalgamation of all the fundamental information technical analysis is the study of price hence by studying price all the fundamentals have already been taking into consideration hence we can conclude that all the fundamentals affect the price since the technical analysis is the study of price movement it automatically takes all the fundamentals into consideration follow emperorbtc candlesticks technical analysis starts and ends with candlesticks a clear understanding of candlestick is a must to trade while the subject of candlesticks is really vast there are only a few basics you need to understand the candlestick is used instead of a line chart because a simple line chart doesnt tell the movement at a given period of time whereas a candlestick tells you the high low open and close at a given time period there are of kinds of candlestick and it’s an unending study but to start with i want to explain two important candles hammer the engulfing hammer in simple terms it’s a bottom reversal candle with a short body and long wick this can be spotted at potential bottoms follow emperorbtc engulfing this occurs after a move is invalidated because of a sudden price movement in the opposite direction by the next candle example below the basic concept and assumption while studying the candlesticks is that a candle with long tail wick has seen the buyers being successful in pushing the price up by buying at this price level even though there was a significant selling a candle with a short body long tail wick denotes supply absorption similarly a candle with a long overhead wick is bearish and shows that even though the bulls tried to push the price up the supply was too high for the price to go up follow emperorbtc adding the above two we can conclude that a candle with a short body and with both a long upper wick and a long lower wick is a candle denoting indecision and confusion in the market it might denote a reversal or could act as a warning for an end of a trend in this tutorial we will learn to identify the supply and demands zone on the chart for entering high probability trade before learning anything else this the topic to master after reading this tutorial please open a live chart and try to identify the supplies and demand zones using candlesticks to find demand and supply apart from using candlesticks to identify price momentum in a certain time period candlesticks can be used to identify the demand and supplies zones demand and supply zone is different from support and resistance using candlesticks to find the demand and supply zone is a high probability method to find a profitable entry since in the demand and supply zone there can be multiple entry triggers the aim after identifying demand and supply zones is to enter at a point which has multiple entry triggers at one point finding supply and demand pressure using candlesticks candlesticks can be used to find supply and demand pressure especially in intraday trading i hope this changes how you view and use candlesticks on a daily basis candlesticks with a long tail wick about times their body have overcome a big supply zone this means that below that candle existed a huge supply order which was absorbed this is generally bullish means the demand in that zone was able to overcome the supply follow emperorbtc at this zone traders could look for a safe long entry look for candles with a long tail it should have bounced off of a previous resistance now turned support we will learn more about support and resistance in the next lesson for now only concentrate on demand and supply zone wait for the price to break a resistance above the same principle is applicable with candles with a long overhead wick this implies that the candle was not able to absorb all the supply above itself which is generally bearish we should look for signs of reversal at this level follow emperorbtc in a similar manner on confirmation of a candle which failed to absorb the supply above a safe short entry can be made look for candle with long overhead wick wait for previous supply to be broken see pic below for a short entry confirmation a confirmation in trading is a positive signal to establish a bias for for an entry example if the current candle looks bullish a safe entry with confirmation would be when the price on the next candle goes above the highest price of the set bullish candle retest after a price breaks a certain resistance it comes back to the point where the resistance was to establish that the resistance has been broken and the same resistance has now been turned into a support for the price structure let us try to understand the trade by using the following concepts of demand zone supply zone uptrend line a detailed tutorial will be uploded on this breakout retest confirmation follow emperorbtc how to find a short entry after a supply zone long overhead wick candles generally denote supply wait for them to close at same level find new support wait for it to break wait for support to turn into resistance enter short trade upon confirmation follow emperorbtc so in this tutorial we have learned the concept of supply and demand and how to identify on chart to reiterate the use of supply and demand once mastered is the most useful tool to find high probability trade entry most beginners learn it very late hence are unable to identify high probability entry zones it must be noted that supply and demand zone is not a tool for entering a trade but a tool for identifying the zones and areas of interest for high probability high profit trade instead of spending too much time to identify the kind of candle stick that has been printed on a chart we should rather concentrate on what the candle is trying to say about the demand and candle structure as a trader our soul aim is to identify the trend whether the demand and supply is more and enter it please read this tutorial several times and try to identify the zones on your own on historical chartsdo not worry about finding the entery points right now only try to identify the zones finding entries will be taught in the next lessons i hope this tutorial was useful this is the first trading lesson don’t worry or give up if you didn’t understand a few concepts always here to help love emperorbtc follow emperorbtc introduction to candlesticks trading bitcoin masterclass part deep dive into candlesticks part in the previous pdf we studied demand and supply zones introduction to candlesticks in this pdf we will cover candlesticks in some more detail discussing the major candlesticks and their types importance of candlesticks technical analysis starts and ends with candlesticks without proper understanding of candlesticks you should not be trading please note candlesticks are the most important tool in technical analysis however i always use them in confirmation with other confirmations like support and resistance and volume using candlesticks without risk management will always lead to liquidation risk management is far more complicated than you think ive made masterclasses about risk management please read them before trading nothing can teach you to trade but trading itself as soon as youre done reading this pdf go and practice the content on live or historical charts and observe how volume and sr play a role in them while there are of types of candlesticks im sticking to the most important ones that are actually practically used in trading follow emperorbtc tip dont get stuck in memorizing the names of the candlesticks you need to understand the logic behind their formation and use that understanding to predict the future prices basic candlestick understanding the fat part of the candle is called the candle body candle open to close the thin line above and below the body is called the wick highs and lows general assumption the longer the candle body is the more intense the buying or selling pressure conversely short candlestick bodies indicate little price movement and represent consolidation wicks plays a really important part in understanding the story behind the candlesticks it shows the fight between the buyers and the sellers and who won it in continuation we will learn to read the wicks follow emperorbtc no wicks candles existing of full body and no wicks showcase the highest buying and selling pressure these are known as marubozu candles example follow emperorbtc long wicks long upper wick candles with long upper wick and short body below denotes that even though the bulls tried to push the price higher the sellers took control and there was just too much supply at this point to push the price up long lower wick candles with long lower wick tail indicates that the bears tried to push the price down but the selling pressure was absorbed and the price managed to go up follow emperorbtc spinning top spinning top has long top and bottom wicks with a narrow body this implies indecision in the market however if a spinning top appears at the top or bottom of the trend it means a trend reversal this is explained in the chart below follow emperorbtc doji there are many types of doji candles but we will focus on the concept of a doji a doji is identified by a narrow body and long wicks it means that the price closed and opened at almost the same price this means grave indecision in the market doji needs to be only relied upon after further confirmations from volume this further confirmations and confusing concepts like dragonfly and gravestone will be discussed later however a doji can have a different meaning depending on where it occurs the proportions of the wicks follow emperorbtc a trade involving the doji candle is explained below hammer a hammer is regarded as one of the most important reversal tools it occurs at reversals and signifies the end of a trend the candle is marked by a long wick and an almost narrow body with small or no upper wick follow emperorbtc conclusion long candle body more intense buying or selling pressure short candle body consolidation long bottom wick sellers trying to push the price down but not succeeding long top wick buyers trying to push the price up but not succeeding narrow body and same proportion wicks indecision and could also mean the end of the trend long wick and thick body occurring at the bottom or top of a trend trend reversal if combined with volume follow emperorbtc a tip go to tradingview and use the candlestick pattern indicator to automatically identify the candle types ps the indicator is no substitute for any form of learning identification doesn’t mean being able to use the information invest in your knowledge this was an intro to deep dive into candlesticks we will completely master the over time always here to help love emperorbtc follow emperorbtc support and resistance mastering horizontal support and resistance for trading bitcoin this is the most comprehensive realworld guide to support and resistance this is everything that you need to master it it’s an exhaustive guide don’t read study it introduction sr must be the most underrated tool in trading which isnt given enough time or attention by most beginners many successful traders personally known to me rely solely on sr this should speak enough for its importance we will study the following follow emperorbtc focus of study understanding sr identifying and drawing a valid sr nature of sr when it breaks fake breakoutbreakdown identifying entryexit at sr lines how institutional traders stop out retail traders stop loss hunting high probability entryexit sr can be categorized as an area of supplydemand which acts as a probable zone for entry exit trending support and resistancetrendlines horizontal lines denoting a price of either support of resistance we will be studying these horizontal lines in this thread follow emperorbtc definition a support line indicates a price where the buying pressure is more than the selling pressure acting as a base for an upward bounce of price to elaborate the demand is greater than the supply at these levels hence an upward move in price is generally probable drawing a support line a good starting point is to zoom out on the time frame that youre trading and try to touch as many lower points as logically possible the support should be easily visible upon minor observation and you shouldnt have to hunt or look hard for them follow emperorbtc comment it’s practically acceptable if the support line crosses a candlewick or doesnt touch the wick or only touches the wick the support line doesn’t have to be perfectly aligned we are mostly looking for zones rather than a perfect straight price line the examples below illustrate the support line overlapping with candles and wicks or not perfectly touching the candles in both these examples the support line is valid follow emperorbtc resistance resistance line indicates the price where the selling pressure is higher than the buying pressure to elaborate the supply is greater than the demand which pulls the price lower there’s a good probability of price retracing from this price line just like support line zooming out on the time frame that youre trading and try to touch as many high points the resistance should be easily visible upon observation and you shouldnt have to hunt or look hard for them examples of resistance lines below observation the chart above also shows a vital concept of fakebreakout breakout retrace and confirmation it will be explained later in detail understanding breakdown and breakouts a breakout occurs when the resistance line is tested several times leading to an increased demand in that price zone this increase of demand leads to a breakout follow emperorbtc opinion the more times a resistance is tested the weaker it becomes breakdown it is when the support zone is tested too many times leading to an increase is supply at that price point which leads to lowering of price ie breakdown pic opinion the more times we test a support the weaker it becomes see pic below follow emperorbtc what happens if a support or resistance line breaks they start acting in the opposite nature a support line becomes a resistance and a resistance becomes a support this above concept is of utmost importance in understanding and confirming a trend resistance lines when crossed become new support and the cycle repeats until the trend breaks pic study this chart carefully to see how resistance level when broken at after formation of a new resistance at becomes a new support at follow emperorbtc this cycle continuous till the breakdown take some time to understand the above graph uses of support and resistance intuitively the use of the support line would be to enter a long when the prices bounces off the support line and that of the resistance line would be to go short when the price pulls back from resistance follow emperorbtc however real world trading isn’t this simple and the above usage needs understanding of the following • breakouts breakdown • fake breakdownbreakout • retests • confirmations • stoploss hunting these are explained below one of the more profitable ways to use support and resistance is to use them at the breakdownbreakout zone a breakout leads to a strong upwards rally in price because of a huge demand at the resistance zone long at the breakout follow emperorbtc the exact opposite is true for breakdown which leads to a big pullback in price short at the break down see pic below for breakout and breakdown advanced uses of support and resistance in determining high probability entry below i illustrate the advanced practices used by seasoned traders to determine high probability entries for profits however they are easy to understand upon a repeated reading here we will study fake breakouts and fake breakdowns stop loss hunting study of the above will help us understand how institutional traders stop out the retail traders and provide us with a probable solution against stop loss hunting institutional traders stop out both long and short retail traders at the same time at a similar price zone a very common problem that retail traders face is being stopped out let us understand stop loss hunting in detail follow emperorbtc short hunting at resistance the red line denotes the resistance line at point a few retail traders will short it thinking that the price will go down at the resistance but the price has a small breakout out triggering the stop loss of the people who went short this is a fake out as the price then reverses at the resistance even though the price goes down the stop loss gets hit here the trader loses money even after being right this is short hunting with the same chart we will study long hunting at the resistance the wick crosses above the resistance line most retail traders will long here calling it a breakout the price is then reversed stopping out all the longs this is long hunting at the resistance follow emperorbtc the same exact stop loss hunting is done at the support stop loss hunting for longs and shorts at the support can be seen here this is illustrated in the charts below now that we have understood that taking longshort entries at the support and resistance can get you stopped out let us look at the probable solution first solution is to look for the following breakoutbreakdown retest follow through the process of confirmation and retest can be used for both long and short entries confirming the breakout confirming the breakdown confirming the support confirming the resistance follow emperorbtc this chart explains the retest and confirmation of support in this chart the support is established then the price comes back to be retested and the support is held and confirmed this confirms the support line leading to an upwards rally in the same manner a breakout from a resistance can be confirmed as shown in this chart the resistance is broken the price comes back to confirms the breakout and is confirmed on confirmation a high probability long entry is made follow emperorbtc solution after a breakout or a bounce from the support like wait for the price to break another resistance above the support line or the breakout levels see the example below for entering a long after a bounce at support and break of resistance the same concepts can be applied for going short at resistance or breakdowns the above concepts will help all beginners from stop getting hunted by an institutional order block this module has covered all the information you need about horizontal support and resistance in great depth i will share trendline support and resistance and supply and demand zone tutorials soon study it multiple times and you should be good to go follow emperorbtc risk management part part how not to lose your money please retweet it might help a trader from losing it all fact of the traders lose money we will learn how to be in the top by mastering risk management in the next few threads the most important but most ignored concept according to me all of trading knowledge is futile if you dont follow risk management period since of the traders lose money due to lack of risk management we dont need to further discuss its importance if we dont manage risk mathematically we will for sure lose all the capital for sure in this thread we will try to understand optimum position sizing the rule never risk more than of your portfolio on a single trade is what i prefer is an aggressive approach this might sound bizarre a waste of time but lets understand it further trading with only of your capital doesnt mean your tradeposition size is only of your total capital what it means is that youre risking of your equity in a single trade whatever happens you will not lose more than of your equity on a single trade trade size will be determined by the leverage on that equity this is illustrated in the note below notice how equity at risk of becomes a position size of by risking just follow emperorbtc caution this is just an illustration we will learn to use leverage later leverage usage is a function dependent on the stop loss determined based on ta i use only technical analysis to determine the stop loss and the leverage multiple shall be determined by it we will learn the application of leverage in the stop loss thread but why risk so little capital per math even if you have a very high strike rate ratio of winning trades eg there will come a time when you will have consecutive losing trades high equity risk trades are historically proven to deplete all capital as explained below the chart below shows the consecutive losses a trader will definetely face over a period of time with the given hit rate now imagine if someone with a respectable hit rate of risked of his capital follow emperorbtc in each of the losing trades rekt it might come as a surprise that the most successful and long term traders have a strike rate of around the best traders that i know personally and even myself dont have that high of a hit rate then how does such low strike rate lead to profits in the long run follow emperorbtc the profitability is gained from obtaining a good rr risk to reward ratio over a period of time rr stop loss placements and the use of leverage will be explained in the next threads dont risk more than equity on a single trade position size matters not leverage your position size can be as big as needed while risking only of your equity leverage needs to be determined keeping the stop loss in mind dont risk more than on one trade this concludes part of risk management optimum position sizing it might be boring but is the most important part of trading read it several times next part of risk management to release soon please share the thread to help a fellow trader love emperorbtc follow emperorbtc risk management part part entering the trade entering a trade without ascertaining a certain thing is gambling in this masterclass we will learn the prerequisites to enter a trade dont enter a trade without determinng the following please share we understand what reward to risk popularly called risk to reward is it will be denoted by rr we will also try to bust a few myths about rr and how to avoid losing trades before entering a trade you need to determine things entry trigger stop loss target entry trigger reasons for entering a trade there could be multiple reasons or a single reason for entry generally a set of reasons aka confluence is a higher probability trade and a generally a safer entry follow emperorbtc example of an entry trigger stop loss the price in the opposite direction of the trade where the trade is exited at a loss at this level the reason for the entry becomes invalidated according to ta and the price can then move in the opposite direction probabilistically follow emperorbtc target is the possible price level that the asset might touch based on previous trends or confluence and where a possible reversal could occur target is the next path of least resistance from where the price might reverse we will always only use ta to determine all a combination of the three coming together forms rr we will try to understand what really rr in this thread rr simply is the ratio of the distance between entry and target and entry and the stop loss here is an example of the rr ratio follow emperorbtc rr is generally denoted in ratio form such as or if the target is above the entry and the stop loss is below the entry the rr is you should not be entering a trade unless the rr is known myth a fixed minimum rr is necessary for taking a trade even murphy in his book has advocated for the same but in my opinion it is a wrong benchmark to have sticking to a fixed rr can prevent us from entering a high probability trade at times eg at confluences so what is the right way to use rr and how do traders with low win rate turn out to be profitable profitability depends on factors rr and win rate follow emperorbtc study the chart below the above chart describes how much rr is needed for a certain level of win rate eg if your win rate is you will be at breakeven at a rr ratio of the formula to calculate the same is as below follow emperorbtc the above might seem confusing but the crux of the matter is test your strategy find your win rate use only the rr setups which suits your win rate eg always choose a trade with rr greater than if win rate is around conclusion find your win rate choose trades with rr which suits your win rate base the above only on ta never enter a trade without knowing the target and sl dont get stuck with a fixed rr the completes the risk to reward tutorial it is a must use to tool to avoid trades that dont suit our win rate this gives a huge trading edge as most of the lower win probability trades can be avoided we will learn stop loss placement next please share if this was useful follow emperorbtc stop loss masterclass on stop loss of the traders fail because they dont understand stop loss stop loss is the most important topic to prevent liquidation and avoiding bankruptcy this is all you need to master stop loss there are only tools in trading which will prevent you from blowing up your account risk management stop loss if you dont follow the rules of the above you will fail period in this thread we will master stoploss in detail follow emperorbtc different charts different sl a common fallacy amongst traders is that stop loss has to be a certain fixed percent of loss eg fixing stop loss at this is a very bad idea stop loss should be based on ta alone every setup is different and a fixed sl wont work stop loss invalidation level entry is made only as per ta on a valid reason for a directional move once the reason for the entry has been lost the trade must be exited the event at which the reason for entry ceases to exist is the invalidation level entry example invalidation point reached get out stop loss is a tool to be absolutely used as soon as the setup reaches an invalidation point always establish the invalidation point before entering a trade as soon as the invalidation event turns true exit without a second thought follow emperorbtc once the reason for the entry has been lost exit the trade as the premise for the entry no longer exists if the entry was made because of a support being confirmed but if the support gets broken the reason for the entry no longer exists and hence a stop loss must be entered let us understand placing the stop loss with the help of few examples i will only be using simple supportresistance reasons for entry to keep it simple placing sl during consolidation breakout note i place it a little below the invalidation level to prevent stop hunts follow emperorbtc placing stop loss with supply demand zone recognition breakout retest confirmation supply zone flip breakout confirmation lets try to understand a bit advanced stop loss using obv volume price goes up volume doesnt price goes down volume goes up this is bearish price goes up obv doesnt support is broken bullish invalidation sl entered follow emperorbtc note this is how top was confirmed stop loss is a very controversial topic as some traders dont like to place a sl order as it could lead to stop loss hunting some traders swear by a strict stop loss order being placed as soon as an entry is placed the solution to this dilemma is discussed below place the sl below the invalidation point to avoid sl hunting by wicks exit the trade on invalidation with using sl manually after the invalidation is confirmed to avoid stop loss hunting i personally exit manually after invalidation is confirmed to prevent sl hunting follow emperorbtc we will learn more about stop hunting in the next thread conclusion stop loss cannot be a fixed percentage as all trade setups are different stop loss is nothing but an exit at an invalidation level reason for entry no longer valid stop loss use only ta to find stop loss stop loss invalidation level always have the stop loss determined before entering a trade you dont have to post the sl order you can exit manually on invalidation to avoid false wicks aka stop hunting ps dont be in a rush to move your sl to breakeven this leads to your market participation without any benefit we will learn about this concept part of trading bitcoin masterclass read the thread again practise it with support resistance and place sl at invalidation every setup needs its unique sl read the charts adapt to different setups practice practice practice hope this helps share if you found it useful to help other traders follow emperorbtc volume part masterclass on volume for trading bitcoin this is module to the most comprehensive realworld guide to volume analysis volume is a simple yet most powerful tool this is everything that you need to master it please retweet so many more can see it and benefit price and volume are the only parameters you need to trade successfully all indicators and tools in existence are derived from the above we will complete the volume study in modules in this thread we will cover the module consisting of the following topics meaning volume average what is highlow volume why is volume importantsmart money volume trends and reversals entry at supportresistance conclusion what is volume it refers to the amount of asset traded over a fixed time purchase and sale of unit is regarded as volume of unit and not follow emperorbtc eg if the volume of on binance for btc is million usd it means theres been a purchase and sale of million usd worth of btc the table below explains how cumulative volume is calculated follow emperorbtc many authors themselves get the concept of total volume wrong eg below is an extract from a forex trading tutorial where the concept of total volume is incorrectly explained on its own the volume has no use eg its of no use to know that the volume of bitcoin in the last hours was billion usd however when combined with previous volumes and price action its helpful in taking a trade this is explained below what does low volume and high volume mean lowhigh volume and lowhigh liquidity is a different concept when we talk about lowhigh volume were taking in a relative term a low volume refers to a volume lower than the average volume and vice versa for high volume follow emperorbtc what does average volume mean it refers to the moving average of the volume calculated on the basis of previous sessions the average could be of any time period the default average on tv is i use here is how you can viewchange it so why is volume study important an increase in volume denotes an increase in interest and buyingselling by holders of big funds institutions aka smart money smart money are the holders of higher capital and more information its generally believed that smart money has access to better analysis and more info hence the levels that see the higher volume is regarded as an area of interest smart money moves in to buysell at a certain level increasing the volume substantially a lower level of volume sees buyssells only from the retail investors with little capital showcasing a period of weak hands buying and a time of uncertainty follow emperorbtc conclusion higher volume smart money with more info and funds buying hence its an area of interest effects of volume the effects of volume on price can be understood with the help of the following cheat sheet we will discuss all situations in detail we will also study where we can enter a trade and increase our positions after we have discussed all the scenarios price increases with increasing volume the volume here acts as a support to the uptrend this kind of uptrend is said to be confirmed by volume follow emperorbtc in the chart below see how in an uptrend the volume too incrementally increasing confirming an uptrend with volume expansion price increases with decreasing volume see the chart below following a downtrend there is a slight uptrend many traders would assume this to be a reversal however this is accompanied by decreasing volume this proves it to be just a correction and not reversal hence increase in price with a decrease in volume points towards an uptrend not supported by volume it isnt safe to long this uptrend this kind of price volume movement denotes a correction in a downtrend rather than a reversal follow emperorbtc price decreases with increasing volume when price decreases with increasing volume the volume here confirms the downtrend the chart below denotes a short entry and an addition to position upon further break of support this is a multiconfirmation entry when the sudden increase in volume leads to a downtrend and the support zone is broken this leads to a high volume as well as high momentum entry high momentum short previous support broken also see how the position is increased upon breaking of a further support price decreases with decreasing volume this decrease in price is not confirmed by volume and hence can be regarded as a correction in uptrend and not confirmation notice how the volume decreases upon downtrend and hence this isnt a reversal for a short entry follow emperorbtc the bull market of saw an ath of however the ath was not accompanied with equally high volume notice how the volume at ath is lower than the average volume the volume at ath is equal to what it was at levels it was a warning for many for the upcoming dump trade entries at support a support is confirmed with a volume expansion a long entry can be taken here which is generally a high probability trade to be more sure you can enter upon breakout from a local swing high as in this case follow emperorbtc long entry at resistance is showcased below notice how there is a sudden volume expansion at the resistance which the volume rising substantially above the average volume here we enter after volume expansion and retest for a high probability trade the short entries can be entered in the similar fashion it has also been illustrated in case no hence increase in volume confirms the trend direction of the trend it is important to relate the volume to the average volume end of module most of my successful trades were based only on volume analysis there will be total modules we will discuss volume divergences obv pattern volume breakouts volume profile market profile in the upcoming modules all the best study it many times follow emperorbtc bullish divergence masterclass on divergence part get ready to master the most profitable tool in trading for predicting the tops and the bottoms a bit complicated but if you read this thread you will master it completely for scalping and swing trades share it all new traders need it part aim to help traders identity divergence and learn entry triggers most traders can identity a divergence but dont know how to use it to time the entry we will try to master the entry in this thread all realworld trades taken because of divergences have been shown below when price moves in a certain direction the momentum oscillator too should move in the same direction and manner eg when price makes a higher high the momentum oscillator too should make a higher high this is called convergence see example below follow emperorbtc in a rare occurrence the momentum oscillator and the price dont follow a similar path this phenomenon is called divergence it occurs because the average change in the lookback period the time period of the oscillator is in a different direction as compared to the price divergences are used to find a potential reversal on the larger time frame or a swingscalp opportunity on the lower time frame a minimum of hour time frame is preferred since they may fail very rarely it is better to accompany the entry with further confirmations important points we will cover rsi divergences macd and obv will be covered after a masterclass on those indicators coming soon prices in this thread refer to the lows only the closing value is chosen for studying divergences since the source for rsi is the closing value bullish divergence marketstructure it is formed when the downtrend price move is going to reverse the lows of the price and oscillator are not in sync useful in predicting the bottom to find bullish divergences always look at the lows of the oscillator and the price follow emperorbtc tips dont look for divergences in a nontrending market there must be clear new levels ie higher high higher lows or lower highs and lower lows formed divergences are very reliable adding further price movement confirmations leads to a more profitable setup strong bullish divergence the price makes a lower low but the oscillator makes a higher low this means although the price is decreasing the overall average rate of change in the chosen period is increasing ie the sellers are not selling at the same momentum entry using the same chart above the concept of supply absorption candle momentum confirmation supply zone retest adding position on retest confirmation is illustrated in this trade all these have been used in sync with divergence for a high probability entry follow emperorbtc medium bullish divergence the price makes a double bottom same level as earlier low and the oscillator makes a higher low this means that at the same price levels the momentum is increasing illustration with a trade example presented below follow emperorbtc weak bullish divergence the price makes a lower low but the oscillator has the same low levels double bottom this means even though the price is decreasing the momentum is intact illustration of weak divergence presented below follow emperorbtc trade using the same setup this was one of the most beautiful trades i have ever taken pure price movement explained in the chart confirmation of bullish divergence bullish candle confirmation entry channel breakout capital addition upon retest exit upon sr break here is another trade that was taken based on a weak bullish divergence with candlestick confirmations divergence confirmed supply absorbing candle appears doji in a downtrend bullish kicker entry made above candle in point follow emperorbtc hidden bullish divergence i dont trade it in a weird manner the price increases the momentum oscillator value decreases this signifies that even at a reducing momentum there is enough buying interest to push the price up explained with a trade setup below this completes the part of divergence masterclass remember for bullish divergence only look at the lows read it several times it will change your trading game will release part soon bearish divergences please share it to help a fellow trader love emperorbtc follow emperorbtc bearish divergence masterclass on divergence part this is the final part of the divergence masterclass we will cover bearish scenarios and shorting lets go note we only look at the value of the body of the candle and not the wicks bearish divergence only looks at the highs remember bearish divergence is used to find the tops so look at the highs only strong bearish divergence the price makes a higher high but the oscillator makes a lower high this means that even though the price is moving higher the average momentum of the look back period is decreasing this is a potential top signal trade here is the shame chart explaining the short entry using short confirmation sr break ema support exit on support break take the time to study it follow emperorbtc here is another setup i used which luckily caught the exact top giving a short movement notice the volume expansion medium bearish divergence here the price makes a double top but the oscillator makes a lower high this means that at the same price level the momentum has decreased this is one of my personal favorite setups trade setup using the same chart a bearish entry is explained when the support line breaks notice the use of bearish engulfing retracement volume follow emperorbtc weak bearish divergence the price makes a higher high but the oscillator makes a double top this means that the average momentum isnt ready to go up even as the price goes up simple confirmation breakdown setup explained below follow emperorbtc hidden bearish divergence the price makes a lower high but the oscillator makes a higher high this means that the price is going down even after theres an increase in the average momentum in the lookback period trade setup this setup although did not catch the absolute top but provided a highprofit short entry notice how the accumulation zone break is used as a short trigger this completes the last part of the divergence masterclass for rsi we will cover macd and obv in near future threads this is a very powerful and profitable concept read several times master it all the best follow emperorbtc open interest masterclass on open interest oi is the most important tool for leverage trading its the best tool to judge longshort sentiment true volume strength market structure true liquidity shift in trend please share it every trader needs it this is all you need open interest is the metric that tells you the number of open derivatives contracts futures or options each contract has sides buyer and the seller or longs and shorts the number of openactive trade contracts is called open interest people often confuse volume and oi while they are related they arent the same volume talks about the number of contracts traded during a day buy sell contract volume open interest is explained below follow emperorbtc oi talks about open contracts ie open positions each contract has sides a buying long and a selling short side hence in one trade a buyer goes long and the seller goes short this forms one contract and not two this one contract is denoted as open interest oi calculation its not difficult and you can understand it very easily with some patience traders a b c are in the market a and b think the price will go up and enter a long of contracts each c thinks the price will go down and enter a short of contracts follow emperorbtc in the above case a and b have entered longs together and c has entered shorts the total contracts open in the market are and hence the open interest is on day a decides to add longs b decides to close longs c does nothing the total open contracts remain the same conclusion oi doesnt change when contacts are transferred it changes only when newer contracts are created amongst the participants or be new players day d a new trader enters the market with short entries a increases his long entry by total open contracts conclusion new open interest is created when new contracts are created either through new traders or through new market participants follow emperorbtc key takeaways from the calculation oi means open contractspositions there has to be a long for every short hence derivatives trading is often called a zerosum game oi will increase only when new contracts are created in the market like volume explained in the chart below oi has no use on its own its just data however when studied along with price it becomes one of the most important tools for leverage trading ever i always use oi data for swing trading explained below follow emperorbtc open interest like price is continuous data the new contracts opened are added to the existing oi and that becomes the new oi value volume on the other hand is calculated per day and is not continuous let us now understand the different scenarios in open interest and how to use them long buildup long covering unwinding short buildup short covering unwinding long buildup price goes up oi goes up a scenario where the price of the asset and the oi increases simultaneously is called a long build up here the market participants are entering into new contracts and the long sentiment is stronger pushing the prices higher follow emperorbtc long coveringunwinding price down oi decrease in this scenario the oi and the price both decrease this happens because long previously entered are taking profits ie contracts are being closed reducing the oi follow emperorbtc this is also a declaration of larger traders covering closing their longs since they feel the target has been reached or the trend has reversed this mostly occurs after the price has seen a substantial rise see the chart above and is looking for a retracement or a reversal short buildup price down oi up in this scenario the price goes down with the oi increasing the sentiment to open up a short trade is stronger new contracts are being formed and hence the oi is increasing short entry scenario explained follow emperorbtc short covering unwinding price up oi down here the price increases with the oi decreasing this means that the people who had entered into a short position are closing their entries this generally occurs after the price has made a substantial correction the open interest data when studied with price movement becomes a very strong indicator to be used with price action trading below we will understand two setups for different scenarios long and a short entry please take the time to study them in detail short buildup explained in chart short build up support break retest of support invalidation short entry with oi confirmation position addition exit with supply absorbing candle follow emperorbtc long buildup explained in chart long build resistance break volume expansion oi confirmation study this in detail how oi confirms a long using oi follow emperorbtc lets look at price movement and how its indicated by oi here we see a clear short buildup where price decreases while oi increases when the target for a short entry is achieved the bigger players exit their contracts leading to a reduction in oi and relief bounce avoiding false reversals reversal points are used to enter a swing trade however many traders get trapped in a false reversal follow emperorbtc here is an example to a voice a false reversal using oi open interest is the most important day trading tool many traders dont understand it enough this thread is all you need read it multiple times practice it on live charts share and leave a like if this was helpful will continue to make more detailed threads emperorbtc follow emperorbtc head and shoulders masterclass on head shoulders pattern for trading bitcoin comprehensive guide to head and shoulders pattern made exhaustive enough for trading purposes t’s a frequently occurring misunderstood and arguably the most useful pattern rt would be appreciated hs is probably the first pattern a trader hears of here is what we will cover content nature identification occurrence historical performance finding entries high probability trades stop losses miscellaneous conclusion follow emperorbtc nature the head and shoulders top is a reversal bearish pattern signifying a prospective drop in future prices the formation of pattern with a breakdown from its necklinebase starts a probable bearish move identification a prospective hs pattern should have distinct peaks the middle peak is the head this is the highest point of this pattern sitting in between shorter peaks ie the shoulders there must be an overlap in prices of these distinct peaks the line where these prices overlap is called the neckline a head and shoulders pattern is easily visible so don’t force yourself into finding it the more times the prices overlap the stronger is the pattern note look for symmetry in the shoulders a high time frame high range pattern where the head is not higher than times the shoulder range has higher chances of success follow emperorbtc volume the consensus is that the left shoulder should have the highest volume the head lesser and the right shoulder the least this isnt a rule but a general observation it could change often note in my experience low volume during breakout could hint toward a back test soon a high volume breakdown might not see a retest immediately occurrence the pattern generally occurs after a substantial rise in price ie it occurs when a price has significantly risen and is looking for a reversal john murphy was of the opinion that the neckline is likely to be an upward trending follow emperorbtc however it can occur in a horizontal and less likely in a downward sloping line here is an example of downward sloping hs historical performance hs is probably the best performing pattern in both bull and bear markets although the success rate of meeting the target calculated by range of the depth is only a little more than the rise is good enough to make ample profit the pattern has a low rate of failure the patterns which fail after breaking the neckline give enough upside to exit at breakeven a breakout is generally followed by a throwback to the neckline levels in a trending market here we see a target being met and the price falling further before a throwback throwback means the return of price to the neckline levels follow emperorbtc finding entries the entry should be taken only when the pattern is completed not in an anticipation of a completion example of an anticipated pattern failure the entry is made once the neckline breaks to the downside see the example below wait for the pattern to completely form wait for the breach of the neckline enter only if the above events occur high probability entries and failure the head and shoulders pattern could fail at times here is an example of a failed pattern the failure generally occurs when the volume showcases an anomaly or the market structure is looking only for a consolidation and not retracement follow emperorbtc to avoid the above as much as possible a high probability entry can be entered in the following manners waiting for a retest high volume breakout high momentum breakout discussed below retest of the neckline it is common for the breakdown from the head and shoulders pattern to go back up and test the neckline an establishment of resistance at the neckline is a high probability entry for shorting wait for the retest in case of a low volume low momentum breakout after the retest wait for a bounce from the neckline and then enter follow emperorbtc sometimes the neckline does not get retested in this case if the breakdown is accompanied by high momentum or high volume a safe entry is available here is an example of highvolume breakdown without a retestthat was a safe entry high momentum breakdown if the breakdown is such along with breaking the neckline a previous support is also broken then a short entry can be taken without a retest after the support is broken follow emperorbtc finding targets a common practice is to target the same number of points as is the range of the head many people have different opinion on measuring the range i follow a conservative method to measure from the neckline to the lowest point of the topmost candle stop losses a method used by peter brandt is placing the stop loss above the high of the candle just before the breakout in my opinion this works well however id place it a bit higher considering the volatility of bitcoin illustration below follow emperorbtc study this in deatail complete market structure of hs price is in an uptrend price looks for a reversal forming head and shoulders neck line breaks down followed back a retest of the neckline price declines again at a range equal to the range of the head price then gets a throwback up to the neckline the resistance at the neckline is broken followed by a retest of the neckline and continuation to the upside trade example with entry and stop loss same general strategy can be followed for the different high probability methods mentioned above follow emperorbtc miscellaneous sometimes the market structure see a hs inside a hs the price movement for this structure is exactly the same we might also come across this pattern with or more shoulders on the either side the effect on price remains the same follow emperorbtc conclusion head and shoulders is a powerful pattern with high probability of success wait for a confirmation dont anticipate the pattern look closely at the volume during a breakdown read the above thread a few times and you will always have this pattern at your disposal i hope this was useful if you dont understand a point or find it difficult give it a go once more like everything else it gets easier upon practice and repetition follow emperorbtc price action trading masterclass on price action trading an indepth and detailed series on pa trading by the end of this series you will master price action trading chapter price market psychology study this thread will introduce the fundamental block of pa price market psychology how the market perceives the impact of news to influence the price is called price market psychology we will be learning how murphy fring and others give importance only to price and nothing else according to pa price contains all the information needed to make a decision and hence no other analysis is necessary follow emperorbtc price market psychology prices are determined by peoples perception of changing fundamentals the strength of a fundamental is limited to how much impact itll have on peoples psychology about the asset price explanation the price of a freely traded asset is not determined by the news but by the perception of the people about the impact of such news if the news can change the psychology of the market about an asset only then will the price change assets are worth what people think they are worth the psychology leads to multiple perpetual conclusions from one participant to another and hence a trend is formed a price trend because the psychology of a market is overall the same and changes over time in a trend explanation the value of the asset is what people think its worth and the psychology of an assets worth makes the trend this is why asset prices are not randomly scattered on a chart but in a trend an increase in earnings or market growth or technical advancements by a companyasset doesnt determine the trend of the price only the perception of the market towards these changes determines the price more earning doesnt mean higher prices explanation it doesnt matter if the revenue or earnings of a company is increasing or their technology is advancing the price of an asset only depends upon the perception of the people ie market psychology about an asset follow emperorbtc examples below the price of mcdonalds stock continued to decrease throughout the at this time mcdonalds was booming an increase in earnings mass expansion of franchises still the prices decreased this means the market didnt factor the revenues growth to be enough stimulus the price of amazon took years to come back to where it was in do you think in the time period amazon was less technologically advanced than in no its just that the market perception about amazon in was a lot higher than in the later years follow emperorbtc action not just price prices do not act as support or resistance the structure and the path taken to reach there makes them a sr for example if a resistance is broken with low momentum and low volume its likely that its not completely broken the longer the time period or the duration of the chart the better performance of the chart patterns the reason why longerterm trends have a habit of being slightly more reliable is that they are less subject to random noise and manipulation the notion that the upwards movement of the price is because there are more buyers than sellers is not true for any transaction to happen there should be equal numbers of buyers and sellers the difference here is enthusiasm what truly is happens is the enthusiasm of the buyers is more than the sellers for the price to move up there is more psychological enthusiasm to buy than to sell this completes the price market psychology i have skipped the history as its not much relevant this will help you understand how price is the king and thats all you need to study this series will be better than anything on the market stay tuned chapter complete follow emperorbtc altcoin breakout altcoin breakout study in detail breakout pattern accumulation breakout with volume ema bullish crossover breakout confirmed with a retest support established with ema and accumulation resistance exit i had shared a pdf about trading altcoins on telegram i showed my neo trade back in i will be taking the same example here to identify a breakout entry exit using the bitcoin cycle altcoins follow bitcoin price cycle explained earlier one of the most common breakout patterns on most altcoins is cup and handle the name isnt important its basically a smooth bottoming with another retracement thats smaller this is followed by either accumulation or any other bullish pattern follow emperorbtc after the cup and handle formation a period of consolidation occurred very common we could only guess if it was a bullish consolidation or not at that time we will discuss below how a guess could have been made about it being an accumulation during accumulation the average volume rises for the first time on a bearish candle however in this instance the movement when studied with volume closely isnt bearish in nature this is explained in the chart follow emperorbtc this is clearly followed by the volume expansion continuing the price rise to the resistance and volume continuing about the average volume ive explained previously how the more times resistance is tested the weaker it becomes a clean volume breakout with volume expansion and follow through accumulation confirmed study the chart below follow emperorbtc this is the interesting part as for most accumulations we see retest sr flip previous resistance becomes support ema now acting as a support front running the trend perfect entry is made when emas crossover had been bullish accumulation confirmed retest and sr flip ema acting as support follow emperorbtc this was a lucky catch with a bit of skill and a lot of luck as described in the pdf the rr here was massive i was lucky to be in the right place and at the right time many people bought it at a lot lower and sold much higher as described altcoins follow btc the chart of btc perfectly matches neo or any other alt with a delay one could easily study the bitcoin cycle and predict the top on alts as seen here

on the daily chart for and ema ema on the hourly chart acting as support all breakouts confirmed by volume ema sloping upwards on the daily chart and emas should form a bullish cross over the ema should be over the ema after a contraction both emas should be upward sloping the price should be above the emas follow emperorbtc on the hour chart the ema should act as a support and entry should be made upon confirmation by volume here is a chart explaining a trade of profit ema support entry on volume confirmation addition to position upon accumulation confirmation the ema is powerful enough that after the confirmations on the daily charts high probability trades can be made without any other tools here is a trade with entry on support by volume confirmation addition upon retest follow

rewards trading is the most rewarding most efficient and quickest feedback profession it is also the most anxiety inducing dangerous and stressful profession to become profitable always why do of the traders fail trading has no barriers or minimum qualification of entry unlike being a doctor engineer etc most traders start without learning or reading hence they fail imagine flying a without training for it disaster will ensue same for trading the true test of a trader starts in an uncertain market as a trader your aim is to make profit in all kinds of market ranging bullish bearish trends last for months as a trader you should be able to make money by being long or short this is what were supposed to learn you should be equally comfortable going long and going short you need a predefined backtested system if you dont have this you shouldnt even think about trading period predefined your system tells you when to enter backtested tested for historical profitability long term holdings dont hold anything thats below the day moving average this implies a fundamental flaw or a cyclic correction at this point no one knows where the bottom is dont try to be a hero cut your losses take a walk and come back later enter the trend always find the trend on the higher timeframe eg weekly and then confirm it in lower time frame daily and hourly and enter is the same direction dont try to counter trade remember find trend on higher time frame confirm on lower and only then enter the reason traders fail is because most are too lazy to backtest improve upon mistakes sit with live charts draw your supports area of interest enter the trade and see the results live do it as much as you can over an over again trade more learn more follow emperorbtc make a trading journal write down why you entered your target and the results write down what you learnt and what could be different only of you will do it even after reading this not maintaining trading journal means youre wasting your precious time make one now there are no market experts noone for sure knows the future movements dont trust anyone ive seen the best traders being wrong only your experience will bring you luck and profits experts are irrelevant your own experience if you learn from them will teach you best way to learn in to open charts mark your levels use your current knowledge and set entries this is learning on steroids let the market give you feedback your only aim is to not stop and follow risk management do this without stopping conclusion first learn then trade enter with the trend on

candlesticks they are the building blocks of ta there are many forms of graphs like bars heikin ashi renko point and figure but for me candlesticks has worked the best you can find a link to a very basic introduction to candlesticks here start with mastering doji there are about types of doji engulfing patterns hammer marubozu shooting star hanging man tweezers best book that i recommend for leading candlesticks is encyclopedia by thomas bulkowski dont read it in one go study it slowly lines there are types of support and resistances demand and supply zones trend lines horizontal lines demand and supply zone is the area where the liquidity is formed here is a tutorial on how to use candlesticks are a method to find demand and supply i will be posting more tutorial on the same see chapter introduction to technical analysis trend lines are nonhorizontal support and resistance lines they are useful for day trading and giving powerful entries you can find a brief introduction about it here i will be posting a detailed tutorial on trendlines very soon horizontal lines are one of the most important levels on all time frames ive already done a tutorial on them see chapter support and resistance follow emperorbtc if need be you can refer technical analysis and stock market profits by richard schabacker as reference for support and resistance moving averages there are mostly used moving averages simple moving average or exponential moving average there are many traders who claim to have invented a secret moving average strategy i dont think moving averages can work as a buysell indicator rather they help us recognize a trend dont ever make buying or selling decision based on moving averages strategy eg triple ma crossover strategy or crossover strategy they dont work in the long run use them as a trend indicator and for confirmations you can use the moving average feature on trading view and see how they work as support and resistance there are many built in indicator like the indicator to work around with chart patterns the best book for studying chart pattern is the encyclopedia by thomas bulkowski however john murphy had also discussed it in brief in his book i have done a tutorial on the most common chart pattern head and shoulders here see chapter head and shoulders you should start with studying triangles flags pennants cup and handles adam and eve and master them few tools to add to your support and resistance arsenal are fibonacci retracements channels and consolidation zones use these to find support and resistance and not as an independent tool themselves you can enhance your support and resistance zones using ichimoku clouds a bit convoluted for beginners but is a good tool i will be providing my bitcoin settings for ichimoku in future the above topics are more than enough to get you started there are advanced took that i used like open interest volume profile funding rates however i suggest mastering the above

bitcoin full time since seen a lot of traders burn their face here are things you should do before you start trading btc before you even consider taking up trading bitcoin consider the following of you will lose all your capital because of lack of knowledge youre fighting against the greatest minds the sharpest instincts who have decades of experience trading the traditional market you need a predefined backtested and multi scenario system if you dont have this you shouldnt even think about trading period predefined your system tells you when to enter you wait for an entry you know when to exit this is predefined you dont enter anytime else backtested traditional market traders backtest for at least a decade btc traders for the lack of data at least need to backrest for years anything else is unacceptable at best only if your system consistently gives a high probability entry its worth considering paper trading once your strategy has been backtested you need to paper trader at least for a month make paper entries in the live market there isnt enough skin in the game but this gives your realworld live insight into your system once the above has been done you can move on to trading but trading only spot market spot market doesnt offer any leverage which is a blessing for new traders follow emperorbtc try this for a month only if you get successful in the spot market think about moving to leveraged trading the above steps take time patience follow it for a stable but solid foundation before you enter leveraged trading follow emperorbtc recommended books best books to learn trading this is a personal opinion technical analysis and stock market profits by schabacker a difficult read but overall solid foundation technical analysis of the financial market by murphy an easy read for most beginners candlestick and chart pattern encyclopedia by thomas bulkowski a difficult read if you try to finish it in one go take it slow and use it as a reference market wizard series by schwager interesting insights technical analysis and stock trends edwards and magee some might find it a dull books but it is valuable trading price action trends by al brooks would be interesting for those who only rely on indicators there could obviously be better books but im just sharing the ones i liked out of many cheers follow emperorbtc my best trading lessons best trading advice after a decade of trading i have been a fulltime trader for about years now first years were spent in blowing up my account several times here are the best lessons i can share with you please sharert if you find this useful you shouldnt be trading if you dont have a system which has been back tested for at least a few years worth of data or as long as the asset has existed back testing is easy and anyone can do it manually backtest it on the asset of your interest as every asset is different a lessons from jack schwager that stuck with me your system should have an edge period relying only on money management wont work you need an asymmetric bet a low probability system wont work in the long run even with godly money management eg can you consistently win at russian roulette with good money management the answer is obviously no gambling is a low portability bet money management cant earn you consistently with a low probability system your system needs an edge a probability of lot more than follow emperorbtc there is no room for hardwork in trading explanation trading should be calm simple and a waiting game your system should tell you the entry and exit you should not be breaking a sweat if your system isnt there yet dont trade you need hardwork to learn discover improve your system and read new things use hardwork to practice train and improvise the actual act of performance should be easy all of the above is easy patience to execute and wait for an entry is difficult your system wont work all the time and one failure will make your distrust it stick to your system if your system had been backtested papertraded stick to it there is no single system that works build a one that works for you and works good enough check list for entering a trade your system should clearly give an entry you have a predetermined reason for exit all possible support resistances should be clearly known if the above things arent in place dont enter a trade ever any other entry is probably a gamble before you start trading paper trade the live market for a few months there is no rush you are not losing out on anything before you start day trading trade spot for at least a month it gets you used to the system and the volatility without the evils of leverage follow emperorbtc if youre leverage trading a stop loss is a must have a look at this chary from november no one expected this kind of range several of my friends who got in the crypto bull run bus were liquidated no stop loss is a quick passage to liquidation most difficult but important lesson try learning the art not the recipe most new traders want to learn a method a trick or a strategy this wont ever work in the long run as the market changes i cant tell you how many times ive to tweak my system because of fluctuations in market cycle and volatility eg at the cost of being trolled i remember a scene from breaking bad gus fring is going to kill pinkman and ww victor has been watching them cook and can take over ww reminds victor that he wont be able to cook if follow emperorbtc the outside temperature changes when the moisture is higher when the chemical proprieties change due to temperature this saved them pinkman and ww conclusion learn to study the price movement thoroughly from the basics give it time to build a solid foundation all indicators except volume related are derived from price a study of price movement is superior to anything else be fluid with your bias legends like peter brandt are trolled for changing their opinions and bias very often strong price opinions have no place in trading you need to learn that trends change very often there is no shame in changing from a bullish bias to a bearish one if the charts say so have strong principles loose opinions eg today itself i felt like btc could breakdown to but as time progressed i made a long entry at fluidity in bias brings you frequent opportunities dont ever hold onto a losing trade if there are no signs of reversal hopes and prayers dont work in trading get out of a losing trade asap market will give you enough opportunities change with the trend follow emperorbtc i have never been able to catch the top and the bottom and have no interest nor the ability to do so most amount of money is made during the movement between the top and the bottom waiting for confirmations and taking lower profits will yield better result always wait for multilevel confirmations to enter a trade and an entry on multi time frames this lowers the number of entries that you will find but increases the profit probability of your trade there were some tips i had off of my head many traders better than me could teach you something a lot better but this is what comes to my mind right now i hope this was worth your time all the best trading follow emperorbtc scalp short sample a guy with a girls pic as his profile photo messaged me and said its ridiculous that i call you all my family and advised against it i am going to take his advice and continue being ridiculous my family here is the analysis of the short entry entry exit the above chart explains the entry look how i entered after multiple confirmations exit was easy i expected the previous lows to be tested after so many short confirmations and placed my bids there the short went till range but i had my orders at itself could have been a lot more profit but wasnt looking to catch the bottom follow emperorbtc long swing sample analysis of the trade executed today without typos this time entry exit i was already in another trade when the presented ascending triangle was forming basically its a pattern where the resistance keeps getting tested and new higher lows are formed constantly notice how the chart above the volume increased as soon as we bounced off the upward trending trendline forming a new higher low this could be taken as a probable upward move incoming after closing the then existing trade shares in twitter earlier a new entry was made at levels multiple confirmations taken into consideration to enter the trade mentioned in the chart follow emperorbtc after the entry there was a concern if the ongoing uptrend was a temporary pump the price showed many retracements consolidation lowering of momentum at the resistance and retests this led to a belief of the uptrend being organic and not a temporary pump i tweeted yesterday that we need to keep a close eye on these levels the price action then taking place mimicked the sudden dump that took place on may however we didnt exist for the following reasons mentioned in the chart a true test of patience it certainly was follow emperorbtc the exit was taken at levels multiple confirmations for exit have been mentioned in the chart obviously now we know it wasnt a perfect exist but i followed my system p s the fake ascending triangle breakout will be explained in a tutorial on triangles in future this might be a tough and timeconsuming read there are a few new terms you might have to google a little bit eventually you will get it upon repeated reading all the best shared on twitter earlier thats what i meant cant escape the typo it seems follow emperorbtc day trading strategy crypto daytrading secret strategy simple high profit no nonsense one of the best strategies for scalping crypto share it to help all beginners we will use three basic indicators pivot points vwap stoch rsi note this strategy will have a much higher probability of success if basic price action volume and candlestick pattern is kept in mind use the strategy i will introduce the tools and then explain the strategy i will talk about the calculations to arrive at the indicators separately important dont use the indicators alone eg stoch rsi has less than hit rate so you cant use it alone to trade tool pivot points they are reversal points based the historical prices go to the indicators tab and type pivot point standard the settings to be used have been disclosed in the pic below note you can choose your own settings but i have disclosed the ones i use follow emperorbtc follow emperorbtc this is what they will look like ignore all notations and just remember all the lines are support or resistance lines lines of interest it doesnt matter if its been denoted as pr or s we will learn how to use them below practically you can also use the custom indicator for pivot point by hpotter the settings for this indicator are already tweaked by the author note i dont know the author hence not able to provide credit follow emperorbtc tool vwap volume weighted average price indicates an overall trend of the market by including volume in the average prices sometimes it filters out fakeouts with low volumes hence being a powerful indicator we are looking for a vwap cross note on vwap it cannot be used on its own it works best on time frame lower than hours i have highlighted my vwap settings below follow emperorbtc tool stoch rsi it is comprised of lines k the faster line blue line in example d the slower line red line in example when the blue line goes above the red line its a bullish crossover note we will not deal with the concept of overbought and over sold here conditions for long entry the tools mentioned should give the following signal • bullish stoch rsi crossover • vwap break to the upside • pivot point support established or resistance break the sequence of signals doesnt matter note exact opposite for shorting follow emperorbtc • strategy works best for scalping • can be combined with volume expansion • occurrence of candlestick pattern increases probability only enter after all three of the above have taken place entry to be made on candle confirmation next candle above the current candle understanding of price actions and practice over time will make this the most successful and addictive strategy here is an example of pivot points acting as support and as resistance on the next target follow emperorbtc using basic knowledge of volume candlestick patterns confirmations will lead to a higher probability entry note it will reduce the amount of entry but increase the profitability ration example follow emperorbtc conclusion • use the strategy for daytrading •dont use the indicators alone •wait for all the signals • this is not a perfect strategy it will fail follow risk management always combining it with pa volume will give magical results so this is my secret and now its yours i enter into many scalp entries but dont share much because •its too fast •needs constant management •is risky if done without risk management try is on live charts and please share it a lot love you guys i need to sleep now follow emperorbtc altcoin swing strategy altcoin

enter after fa as mentioned in the above we begin to find the entry i use only charts to find the entry jack d schwager has mentioned many times how he only uses ta to find entry for his investments we discussed in detail in introduction to ta how chart is all you need strategy for hodl entry ema cross volume around the cross ema squeeze before the cross enter on breakout candle crossing the high of previous candle volume must increase after ema cross breakout better if breakout candle is an engulfing follow emperorbtc i am sharing the settings for the ema here time frame daily chart the cross we are looking for a bullish cross of the and the ema these are my personal settings and can be tweaked by anyone but this is what i use the red has to be above green and so forth with blue and black follow emperorbtc candles hidden for clarity volume this doesnt always occur because very few people use this technique but while the whales accumulate you can see a little increase in volume if a clear volume change occurs it means the breakout has a higher probability illustrated below follow emperorbtc the squeeze it means the mas coming closer illustrating an accumulation this can suggest a change in trend in either direction if the volume is increasing during squeeze it is most likes bullish the volume also must carry through after the breakout the entry this is where true edge comes in play the entry edge can only be gained with experience failure and a lot of trying here are two entry options below the risky entry is when the candle next to the engulfing cross the engulfing candles high follow emperorbtc here is an example of how it works please note use volume for entry use pa for confirmation this is not fool proof but gets better with experience the exit has been done as one of the emas turns bearish conclusion wait for ema squeeze look for volume on accumulation find cup and handle or rounding bottoms use pa for confirmation exit on bearish crossover this is my strategy of buying alts for the short terms its simple and it works i am in many alt positions right now with this tool this is for hodl i will share alt swing trading tutorial soon a request please try it on

on hour and daily time frame tp bearish cross share it ema used for a bullish crossover is and when ema is above ema its considered a bullish trend when cross occurs with volume expansion its even better hope the strategy is clear follow emperorbtc volume exit masterclass on volume exit when should you exit a trade determine exits using volume we will try to explore how understanding the nature of volume and price movement price increase with volume increase is bullish price increase with volume decrease is not bullish price decrease with volume increase is bearish price decrease with volume decrease is not bearish note please read the comments above carefully and have a look at the cheatsheet warning be careful with the and statement not bullish doesnt mean bearish and not bearish doesnt mean bullish hence if such a volume divergence occurs look for exit follow emperorbtc volume below average is caution if there is price expansion with volume below the average volume or if there is price contraction with volume below the average volume this should be taken as a sign of caution the price movement is happening with low market participation if the movement after entry occurs with volume below the average volume look for exit price action follows the direction of bigger market participation volume below average only retail entry higher volume bigger player entering the market follow emperorbtc volume divergence i have explained volume divergence in the examples below which is selfexplanatory if such an event occurs look for further signs of reversal for an exit follow emperorbtc trade examples support region tested several times price decreases with increasing volume entry made on new support break trivia the more a support is tested the weaker it gets the same principle can be applied to all the scenario described in the cheatsheet candle body and volume anomaly this theory was first described by david h weis look for an exit if there is uptrend increasing volume low body spread long upper wick sudden volume jump this is an anomaly in pa and should be looking for reversal follow emperorbtc read the chart retracement vs reversal sometimes people judge a normal retracement as reversal i dont suggest shorting a retracement the short below explains retracement position should be added on retracement please read the chart carefully i have explained how to use volume to judge exiting a trade you can summarise the above and try them on live charts via paper trading make such entries to master volume i hope this was useful please share it if you found it useful all the best follow emperorbtc day trading strategy with rsi day trading strategy with rsi rsi forms higher low price makes lowerlow volume decreasing on price retracement vwap broken and support established entry on resistance break note not for complete beginners time frame minute try it share it if the price goes low with a decrease in volume it means there is a probability of the sell pressure ending this same concept has been used able to find a reversal follow emperorbtc find tops in swing trading find tops in swing trading • obv divergence • decreasing volume as price increases • increasing volume as price goes down • any bearish candle and the next candle crossing its low note the short entry would be when the next candle crosses the harami low for those asking these techniques work on any market forex equity commodity crypto market changes concepts remain the same follow emperorbtc high probability altcoin entry guide high probability altcoin entry guide in this guide we will only study about the technical aspect charts to be kept in mind while taking a position in an altcoin note the best money is made in the smaller cap alts by positioning yourself on a technical price trigger entry and holding for months i don’t recommend trading small caps on a daily basis daytrading stay with major caps for day trading all the best trading altcoins i will try to share some good projects on my telegram telegram we will try to cover in brief the following topics in this tutorial breakout pattern accumulation breakout with volume ema bullish crossover breakout confirmed with a retest support established with ema and accumulation resistance exit breakout breakout means the price overcoming a resistant and is able to break free from it to make higher move here are several breakout patterns we will try to understand one here one of the most common breakout patterns on most altcoins is cup and handle the name isnt important its basically a smooth bottoming with another retracement thats smaller this is followed by either accumulation or any other bullish pattern follow emperorbtc after the cup and handle formation a period of consolidation occurred very common we could only guess if it was a bullish consolidation or not at that time we will discuss below how a guess could have been made about it being an accumulation during accumulation the average volume rises for the first time on a bearish candle however in this instance the movement when studied with volume closely isnt bearish in nature this is explained in the chart follow emperorbtc this is clearly followed by the volume expansion continuing the price rise to the resistance and volume continuing about the average volume ive explained previously how the more times resistance is tested the weaker it becomes a clean volume breakout with volume expansion and follow through accumulation confirmed study the chart below follow emperorbtc this is the interesting part as for most accumulations we see retest sr flip previous resistance becomes support ema now acting as a support front running the trend perfect entry is made when emas crossover had been bullish accumulation confirmed retest and sr flip ema acting as support illustration below follow emperorbtc entry example as described altcoins follow btc the chart of btc perfectly matches neo or any other alt with a delay one could easily study the bitcoin cycle and predict the top on alts as seen here remember the alt cycle follows btc price cycle follow emperorbtc opinion invest in projects which have a revenue positive model a public team removes the aspect of rug pulls and scams try catching the projects below million look for unique and nonplagiarized white paper the devs must be active on telegram all the best emperorbtc follow emperorbtc reversal candles masterclass on reversal candles people find it extremely difficult to exit trades and find reversals we will learn reversal candles to find change in trend exiting a trades we will discuss hammer in this thread share if you find this useful premise reversal doesnt mean a start of an opposite trend it means reevaluation or slowdown of trend dont take opposite trade on reversal signs eg if a long entry shows a reversal its not a sign to go short take an profits on reversal not opposite trade to illustrate if a reversal candle hammer in this case is formed at the bottom of a downtrend it doesnt mean a long entry must be taken reversal here means a change in change or reevaluation which should make us look for an exit and not an opposite trend follow emperorbtc hammer must occur during a downtrend the body of the candle must be at the top a long tail wick more than the body almost no or very short upper wick opinion many traders believe that confirmation isnt needed for hammer however i always look for it follow emperorbtc important hammer candle can be of either colour red or green it is still a hammer although a green hammer is more bullish but i have seen many red hammers creating a reversal illustration of hammers and chart shared with red hammer follow emperorbtc observation in my personal view tall candles longer wicks outperform short ones hammer with higher volume needs lesser confirmation hammer has a reversal rate however if the next candle closes above the high of the hammer the reversal is sure how to use hammer for trading explained in one chart downtrend reversal low volume hammer confirmation close ema break and retest position addition on ema break follow emperorbtc setup stop loss at swing low aggressive entry on volume cross average volume conservative entry on candle close above hammer exit on ema resistance confirmation i mostly wait for confirmation but traders like bloodgoodbtc tend to have an aggressive entry main summary of a hammer i have written my main point regarding a hammer keep them in mind follow emperorbtc this ends the hammer thread tip use the indicator tab on trading view to help you recognise hammer but this is no substitute for understanding it i hope it was helpful please share it if you liked the thread we will discuss new reversal candles next if you want to learn further all trading tools have been discussed in detail on my telegram from beginner to advanced level its free it works and simple for anyone to understand love you guys emperorbtc follow emperorbtc reversals price action trading masterclass chapter reversals explained in detail likert would be appreciated in this lesson we will be understand what reversal is and how to guess it i will be using pa plus some indicators to find probable reversals opinion pa traders dont really use indicators but i like to use it for some insight time period a lot of people ask me about the time period a lot of times pa can be applied to any time frame from oneminute bars to weekly and monthly charts the interpretation is identical however the only difference is that the battle between buyers and sellers is much larger on the monthly charts than on the intraday higher the time frame the better but the principles stay the same remember chart patterns perform better on higher time frames reversal explained prices dont reverse at once there is a transition period when the prices move in a horizontal manner this horizontal movement is called consolidation consolidation is likely to favour the previous trend that means its generally a continuation follow emperorbtc there could be several types of reversals distribution accumulation pattern reversals tops and bottoms trend continuation consolidation occurs which turns out to be accumulation price continues upwards signs of guesses resistance being touched continuously the more times resistance is touched the weaker it becomes we could guess that its going to break to an upside follow emperorbtc in the previous tweet we could have used volume and other indicators too but i just wanted to use the pa notice the retest of the high of the breakout candle this is extremely bullish tops a simple pa observation shows lower high being formed continuous test of support weakening support breach with volume used for confirmation follow emperorbtc tops bonus here is a clear indication of a top in bitcoin back in i saw the obv being used on tone vays broadcast by an analyst i dont remember their name but i got the insight from there the reasons are explained in the chart distribution here is a beautiful example of breakdown after consolidation after a head and shoulders is being formed on the bitcoin chart hs is confirmed by volume the breakdown is confirmed by volume too follow emperorbtc conclusion reversals dont happen suddenly but after signs of strength in case of upward movement weakness in case of a breakdown consolidation in continuation or reversal it can be guessed by pa or using pa with momentum or volume indicators ive explained the relevant part needed for trading reversals there are infinite patterns that form at reversals but the main concepts remain the same study the consolidation find the signs or strengthweakness this completed reversal leave a
