a trade candlesticks line charts bar charts candlestick charts anatomy of a candlestick trade size how to calculate correct position sizes margin trading pros and cons on trading with leverage i risk management trade setup a trade setup is a thought through plan where you have decided to enter a trade based off technical analysis an entry point is where you will place your orders to enter a trade a stop loss is where your position will be totally closed for a loss if hit a take profit is where your position will be totally closed for a win if hit stop loss is not placed in an arbitrary place eg away but where we are wrong on our trade idea take profit is essential in order to not get greedy and wait for some movement to occurs and loose profits a poor entry would be just buying when price is going up out of fear of mission out emotional trading i risk management summary • trading is a probabilities game in which it is impossible to expect win rate over time • know where your invalidation is before you enter a trade knowing where you are wrong is just as important as where you are correct • always place a stop loss as it is there to protect you always place a take profit as it is there to stop you getting greedy and eventually seeing wins turn to losses • have a full plan for every trade before you enter it is very important do not be afraid of taking a loss it is normal in trading you just have to get into a point in your trading career where you take more wins than losses and that will come with time ii candlesticks line chart is an old western type of charts its among the simplest one simple represents the progression of price in time its very easy to read how price has moved in the past ii candlesticks bar chart it gives more information ● green and red colors gives insights where the price has moved up or down between a given time frame ● you can see the relation between when the price has open and closes in a given time frame ii candlesticks japanese candlestick chart similar to the bar chart easier to read gives clues on what might be happen next as you can distill patterns ii candlesticks how to read a candlestick highest price of the timeframe candles refers always to a given time frame every interval of the time frame a new candle is created opening price closing price the difference between the opening price and the closing price is called body of the candle the highest price and lowest price in relation to the candle body forms a shadow or a wick of the candle lowest price of the timeframe ii candlesticks summary • candlesticks consist of elements ohlc open high low close • they give insights in how price has behaved within a given timeframe • the body of the candle represents where has been the most interest during the candle time • the wicks are visualization of where price attempted to go but failed to remain iii trade size example always know the risk before you enter a trade you must have your setup in play before entering the trade we have a account – we will risk loss of the portfolio with each trade of 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒂𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 𝑹𝒊𝒔𝒌 𝑨𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 𝒊𝒏 𝒅𝒐𝒍𝒍𝒂𝒓 · 𝑺𝒕𝒐𝒑 𝑳𝒐𝒔𝒔 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝒈𝒊𝒗𝒆𝒏 𝒃𝒚 𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒔𝒆𝒕𝒖𝒑 for a trade with a given stop loss at a from the entry point we have 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒂𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 · we are risking of total portfolio with a stop loss trade iv margin trading leverage leverage trading allows you to trade with a larger position size than what you have available borrowing the amount from the exchange pros • • • • cons trade more contracts than you have reap larger rewards grow your account quicker less exposure if used correctly • • • larger losses if price turns against you loose money quicker the more leverage the closer your liquidation price will be trading on high leverage is extremely risky and is not recommended not more of for the beginners iv margin trading example leverage leverage position size position size borrowed from the exchange if prices increases by you will have in profit if prices increases by you will have in profit if prices drops by you will lose if prices drops by you will lose iv margin trading use leverage sensibly • going all in into one trade indicates poor risk management • use leverage sensibly • use adequate risk management favorable example situation your portfolio diversified across different exchanges and you are using multiple trading accounts you have a portfolio worth but only are allocated on an exchange the rest is in another exchange or stored in a hardware wallet you can use leverage to meet the desired position size even though you don’t have the required money on the exchange you want to take the trade with the appropriate risk management you can use leverage to take the trade with the desired position size without moving funds around basics key notes • always protect your capital • risk management is the key • never enter a trade without a plan know your invalidation and targets • horizontals are very strong and important levels therefore they should be marked correctly on the chart • always use two consecutive candle closes to mark a level • support becomes resistance when broken and resistance turns into support when broken • market structure is the king • develop a daily routine always do your ta and make a plan before trading key theory risk management trading edge trade planning supports and resistances how to map support resistances and horizontal levels sr and rs flips when resistance is broken it become support and when support is broken it becomes resistance market structure b how markets move daily routines preparation for a day of trading basics key theory risk management trading edge trade planning key theory trading takes time • • • • never stop nobody got to where they are now by only working at do not expect to be a professional trader and only chart hours a week losses are normal in trading keep going you need to put in the time and accept losses to learn from them years is the average amount of time is required for a trader to become profitable one key aspect that distinguish professional traders from amateurs is consistency in taking profitable trades find a strategy that works best for you and just repeat it processoriented trading trading is not easymoney it is very difficult and timeconsuming to become profitable key theory not a getrichquick scheme • • don’t focus on the smallterm picture but rather on the longterm vision trading is about longevity with toprisk management the longterm vision must be of staying in a consistent gains over time eg compound interest example one trader risks of his account on each trade while the second one risks of his account on each trade if each trader has losing trades in a row the first one will have left while the second will remain with only binance has the feature of scaling the trade size to of your account to basically take your money trade total account risk trade trade total account risk trade key theory – risk management method risk per trade • always know the risk before you enter a trade you must have your setup in play before entering the trade • is not the trade amount but the risk should we lose the trade the biggest loss we will ever take is at maximum of the portfolio this method is good for low balance accounts or less if you are consistent you can scale up to if you are a beginner start even with you should never take a trade with less than to riskreward ratio better more or equal than to risk management is important as if not more than the technical analysis itself longevity is key if your risk on any given position is small relative to total capital then you can take a losing streak key theory – risk management method risk per trade example we have a account – we will risk loss of the portfolio with each trade of 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒂𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 𝑹𝒊𝒔𝒌 𝑨𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 𝒊𝒏 𝒅𝒐𝒍𝒍𝒂𝒓 · 𝑺𝒕𝒐𝒑 𝑳𝒐𝒔𝒔 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝒈𝒊𝒗𝒆𝒏 𝒃𝒚 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒔𝒆𝒕𝒖𝒑 for a trade with a given stop loss at a from the entry point we have 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒂𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 · we are risking of total portfolio with a stop loss trade for a stop loss the trade amount for the example above will be 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒂𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 · key theory – risk management method of equity risk management • never risk more than of total portfolio equity per trade • every trade taken is between and normally at the lower end this method works for bigger accounts few millions not viable for small balance account of a account is not enough example with a trading account the max trade size is and the average trade is longevity is key if your risk on any given position is small relative to total capital then you can take a losing streak key theory there is no best way to trade • • • there is no right or wrong ways to trade only the way that works for you pick an area and master it swing scalp crypto stocks don’t practice on crypto and then start investing in gold a strategy does not have to be complicated the simpler it is the better the majority of time don’t trade with information overload you don’t need a hundred of indicators if you are adding into a strategy or removing from a strategy always ask is this increasing profitability or reducing risk if the answer is yes then add it to the strategy key theory what is your edge strategy • • • • without a strategy you are gambling you have to know where your trading edge is as a trader you should have no opinion just trade the charts the charts never lies to you if you have opinion you will continue to take losses you need to workout your strategy edge to become consistent profitable over time stay humble there is always something to learn to improve and become a better trader your trading edge needs to adjust continuously what works now does not necessarily works in a year whoever says that he never takes a loss is a liar key theory have a plan • • • know when you are going to get out of the trade before you get in stick to you plan always treat your trading methodology like a business simple effective and rememberable if you have a profitable plan but then you take a losing streak you can adjust it just don’t think that the plan is totally a failure plans does not need to be complicated always ask “is this increasing profitability or reducing risk” before adjusting your plan if you go in a losing streak don’t keep trading take a break don’t revengetrade increasing the amount of money traded instead reduce it eg reduce the risk to basics supports and resistances how to map support resistances and horizontal levels supports and resistances identifying supports and resistances • • you want to see multiple touches onto the support or resistance on a high term time frame monthly weekly daily you must master horizontal levels before proceeding to more advanced tools many traders overlook horizontal support and resistances but basics are more pivotal in trading than advanced theories some levels requires more experience as they might seem washed out and not important anymore but they could become important in some cases if you mark out an incorrect horizontal level you will likely loose money never trade of horizontals alone always seek for confluence eg fibonacci retracement which is also horizontals supports and resistances how to map horizontals • • start on higher time frames htf and work your way down monthly ⮕ weekly ⮕ daily ⮕ the higher the timeframe the bigger the supportresistance is if you are day trading you can also map horizontals on timeframe example color system used by daniel monthly purple weekly yellow daily teal cyan orange • • quickly identify levels directly on the chart add templates on tradingview for each color use horizontal ray or horizontal line ltc monthly supports and resistances how to map horizontals example we are looking for levels which has got several touches at least touches on the monthly for a touch is intended when the candle body does not close above the level support and resistance levels are levels where price doesn’t stay there for an extended amount of time three weeks in a row on the same level massive support on massive monthly levels identified by multiple touches price can also come close and make a retracement without even touching them support note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles ltc monthly supports and resistances how to map horizontals example resistance support support note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles ltc monthly supports and resistances how to map horizontals example resistance some of the monthly levels can be redefined by looking at the weekly timeframe if they don’t look quite right resistance support support note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles ltc weekly supports and resistances how to map horizontals example tweezer top not something to likely label always look to the left before going to the right levels are chart specific each asset handle levels differently no clear levels here note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles support no candle body close below the level bounce on the weekly support ltc daily supports and resistances how to map horizontals example when a daily level is right next to a weekly level there’s no point in adding the daily as well resistance no points in adding this daily level as it is near a weekly level note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles ltc daily supports and resistances how to map horizontals example price reaction on horizontal levels note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles supports and resistances trendlines trend lines use the same theory of horizontals you need to see at least two touches to create the trend line touch touches can be viewed as a strong speculative buy touches is an already confirmed trendline touch touch breakthrough of the trendline many traders do not trade the touch but daniel does and often the touch goes through basics sr and rs flips when resistance is broken it become support and when support is broken it becomes resistance bat sr and rs flips support when broken becomes resistance if there are signals of a level being broken its better to go out of the trade once broken supports flips into resistances going forward bounces on the support are getting smaller and smaller until its broken like a ball there’s no much time that you can hold up a level until its buyers exhausts it’s all about supply and demand if you have an area that people are interested in buying but the bounces are getting smaller and smaller it means there’s less sellers then less people are holding up that level and you need to come back down in search for value at a lower price you then see if at that lower level there are people interested in buying or it is still over valued you can reach a value where there is an “agreement” between buyers and sellers and that is when you stay range bound accumulation range support levels good entries for short positions finding a fair value for an asset is all about trading eos good entries for long positions sr and rs flips resistance when broken becomes support resistance level same of sr flips just reversed if you are looking for long or short positions you want to wait for a breakthrough a backtest and a confirmation of the sr or rs flip consolidation under resistance is bullish especially in an uptrend once broken resistances flips into support going forward btc once trendline support is broken it flips into resistance going forward sr and rs flips trendline support when broken becomes resistance trendlines flips strategy is the same as horizontals in uptrend or downtrend lines trendline is acting as support basics market structure how markets move market structure as confluence market structure the fundamentals • reading the market structure ms gives you the ability to identify a trend at any given timeframe • market structure helps you build a case for a potential trade bullish or bearish • with market structure you can identify when a trend has ended and is about to reverse find other form of confluence before enter a trade to determine entry and invalidation point enter a trade only based on a change in market structure might be difficult because the ranges can be very wide especially on swing trading on high time frames market structure directions of the market upwards downwards sideways trending uptrend trending downtrend consolidation breaking the newly made high confirms the uptrend market structure uptrend when price breaches the previous price high it makes a higher high and does not close below the previous low it makes a higher low establishes an uptrend higher high the uptrend is confirmed when the next high is higher than the previous higher high after the confirmation long positions are favorable as the uptrend il likely to continue high higher low low market structure downtrend high the same as the uptrend but reversed lower high the downtrend is confirmed when the new lower high is lower than the previous high lower high low lower low breaking the newly made low confirms the downtrend market structure no new higher highs are being made higher high sideways after a higher high and a higher low coming from an uptrend or a lower high and a lower low coming from a downtrend no new higher or lower highslows are made the result is indecision in price forming a sideway range high a breakout on either sides might occur you can trade inside the range from low to high or high to low you can trade the breakout of the channel as well after confirmation higher low price was forming a potential uptrend no new lower lows are being made after breaking the previous high and making a higher low price continues past the newly made high higher high market structure trend change coming from an established downtrend the price will place a lower low followed by a higher high and a higher low after breaching the new higher high the trend change from downtrend to uptrend is confirmed high after the confirmation you might start looking for a long position lower high coming from an established uptrend higher low the price will place a higher high followed by a lower high and a lower low after breaching the new lower low the trend change from uptrend to downtrend is confirmed after the confirmation you might start looking for a short position low lower low market structure trend change – complex scenario change of trend confirmed only after breaching the start of the down trend we can confirm new higher highs higher high higher high high lower high start of the downtrend still lower high lower high higher low low still lower low lower low lower low downward trendline is being broken early indication that the trend might change market structure support and resistance in order for a trend change to occur old highs or old lows has to be breached it does make sense to pull horizontal lines from older highs and lows backtest in order to see if there is interest in buying at this level otherwise price continues down where price couldn’t breach previous highs means that in that particular level there’s not enough demand as a result the price goes down and the high becomes a resistance resistance support resistance high support once the price breaks through a resistance or support level it is common to backtest it in order to see if there is buyingselling interest now if there’s still no interest the level flip from resistance to support or vice versa market structure is the source of these basic concepts determining where are demand and supply low the higher the time frame the more resistant is the level backtest in order to see if there is enough interest to buy for price to continues up levels are taken from candle closes basics daily routines preparation for a day of trading daily routines routine mark out key levels • • • • • plan all possible setups take trades that ‘comes to me’ routine to be prepared for the day ahead knowing and predicting the best potential setup before the setup is even there be prepared for a bullish or a bearish scenario you must be already ready before the majority of the competition are still working out the plan only take the trade when the setup has been met if you don’t have a plan your plan is to fail not making a trade is a trade in itself daily routines daily sheet all key reference levels and planned setups to take to be prepared for them before they are visible • recognize if there is a bullish or bearish daily open • recognize if the initial balance is strong or not • aware of where the big reference levels are daily routines context you really need to working the context out in the morning it gives you the base understanding and instructions for the day keep context as simple as possible avoid analysis paralysis use the setup and tools that you feel more comfortable with determine your daily bias bullish or bearish trend direction sideways or trending higher time frame elliott wave count watch td on ltf and on htf and get the context of the direction if price is trending in wave aggressively long the dips compound and trail stop loss trending buy the dips and put a trailing stop loss do not take profit often sideways does not add to position buys at the low and sell at the high of the range cvd divergences when in sideways range look for cvd divergences to get the context of what the biggest traders are doing if price is in a wave triangle expect ranges take profits long lows and short highs daily routines important levels cc fibonacci global and local hour emas and pocs daily weekly monthly the global cc is taken from very htf and not interacted with it so much but when it does expect big moves represents support and resistance levels on hours levels where to take trades from the local cc is derived from ltf mostly useful for day traders and are the most respected levels of ema look for confluence with other tools to determine probability of the trade daily routines key horizontal levels biggest trading levels key support and resistance of the day determined by looking for several layers of confluence manually determined there’s no indicators for that if there is a strong resistance level but during the day we break through it when it is retest you can expect to flip as support after identifying the context and the key horizontal levels you can patiently wait for the trade setup comes toward your plan daily routines volume information look at your statistics and journaling keeping your statistics is one of the major way to become a successful trader open interest daily volume and delta funding bullish or bearish what’s the open interest doing on the previous day check if volume and delta are increasing in comparison to previous days current funding check if open interest is increasing or not check discrepancies with open interest daily routines opens and notes prepare for daily weekly monthly opens strategies daniel will give on the daily sheet his key notes for the day ahead identify levels and setup before price reach that levels is extremely useful to become successful a daily sheet requires minutes place alerts and when they hit look for a trade in minutes the rest of the time is free watching a chart a day will not make you a better trader start formulate your plans and then trade them trading psychology key notes • trading without emotions is the key • stick to your plan • truly understand and accept the calculated risk on your trade • greed makes you lose money • when you focus on trading money comes naturally important if you want to take trading seriously do the trades with one dollar challenge as described in a stream trading mindset introduction into trading psychology psychology introduction trading emotions risk management and trading steps before each trade psychology in trading focus on charts and trades do not be greedy trading emotions how to handle trading emotions psychology trading mindset introduction into trading psychology trading mindset working out a trading strategy do you second guess yourself when entering trades have fear during the trade not stick to your original plan of the trade have a plan at all before entering a trade or do you enter the trade in fomo a lot of key points are taken from mark douglas of traders lose money because they don’t have a plan at all trading mindset understanding and accepting the risk people accept they can lose but they do not accept the risk of loosing it example bad trade after our ta or due to fomo we take a long trade with stop loss and take profit set each downwards move causes fear and each upwards move causes hopegreed after an initial uptrend the market structure starts to clearly change with a series of lower low and lower high after the first confirmation of the ms change we say to our self “if it goes below the lower low andor my invalidation point we’ll close” but at every lower high we start to feel that the market might goes up again but punctually it goes down we continue like this until we are liquidated or with a high loss use your invalidation point to get out of the trade don’t stick with a bad trade after it hits your first invalidation point just with the idea that maybe the things are going to change no emotions just trade the chart trading mindset we can lose any trade we take we must accept the risk before entering any trade and we must accept that we can lose any trade we take therefore it’s crucial to put a stop loss and a take profit on each trade we take we are trading probabilities using a probabilistic edge we must be the casino owning the slot machines not only the players example weighted coin we are betting on a weighted coin that has odds of head are we going to put all our life saving on heads no because there is a change that we can loose but we are more willing to take the risk over a course of coins flips because more often than not heads will be the result but you can’t never ever know with a certainty if the next coin flip is head or not all it takes is other person to invalidate any trade and ta we take we still can loose any trade given by our best setup it does not matter how the next trade goes we are trading in a way that on the long term our probabilities to win are higher as a casino owner we know that sometimes players can win and take money from us but on the long term at the end of the day we are walking away with money trading mindset trading strategy challenge work out a setup you are going to take for the next trades and take that setup every time does not matter what others are saying block anything else on each trade use only and record each trade result what went wrong and what could be improved at the end see your win and if any adjustments need to be made if your win rate is higher than the lose rate you can scale up the same setup for bigger trades but if on bigger trades you find yourself exiting the trade sooner or changing the strategy along the way then go back to smaller trades until you find your personal risk tolerance if you are taking trading seriously you need to do this challenge make only dollar trades as you need to find this disciplines first and then you can scale up if you can do the challenge with there’s no reason that you can’t do it with a you need to find a systematic and robotic strategy to trade with no emotions trading mindset the secret to trading “no man ever reached to excellence in any one art or profession without having passed through the slow and painful process of study and preparation” trade without fear or overconfidence when you get a trade setup stop over thinking and think in a percentage over a series of trades perspective instead of try to find the best indicators the best strategy in the hope that the next trade will not be lose acknowledge the fact that is impossible to avoid losses in trading and that we need to trade with a probabilistic edge if you are not willing to accept the risk probably you are trading with too much money winning at trading is easy it takes care of itself but learning how to lose is the most important part as a trader how i deal with losing mentally is extremely important in trading do i let it bother me do i hang on to it or do i release it and let it go when i lose i have to experience the loss feel it learn from it and then spit it out and let it go and focus on the next trade if i hang on to a loss for too long it will pollute me it will affect my next trade and i always have to focus on the next trade the next trade is the most important trade in the world focus on the now i need to know myself the sooner i figure out who and what i am as a trader and play to my strengths the sooner i can work out how to remove my weaknesses when i can completely divorce myself from the money madelost aspect of trading and just focus on the market and making good trades i’ll be a much better trader biggest lessons learned selfbelief believe in myself don’t quit and never lose all my money overall it’s stay in the game and really believe in myself it’s a balancing act between having an ego compared to having too big of an ego know what my strengths and weaknesses are it’s a game of inner exploration mentally traders all now trade from screens a few feet away i shouldn’t be doing that i should be internalizing the screens and making them a part of me eg what i see on the screens should be a part of my psyche it’s not me against the machine the machine data on screens should be part of me sometimes have these zenmoments where clears mind of all thoughts and will be looking at the screen but not actually looking at it but know you subconscious is looking at it then he comes out of this zenlike moment looks at the screen and is like “right i know what to do” observational skills in order to be a good trader i really need to work on my observational skills i need to notice what the market is telling me dont sit there and say “based on the charts the month chart btc is going to xyz level” no lets the market tell you what to do dont won’t buy btc unless the market is yelling at you “buy the bloody bitcoin you idiot” divorce yourself from the opinion and lets the market tell you what to do watch the markets closely but not too closely as sometimes one can look at the screen look away from the screen look back and one’s subconscious mind then tells one what’s there and what to do use the power of observation intuition and subconscious mind as these are very powerful tools when it comes to trading i must have an openmind and be nonjudgmental open myself up to everything utilize the fact that my spirit inside wants to be open and free to everything don’t let anything stand in my way don’t let any dogmasbeliefs stop me from achieving what i want to achieve don’t just watch the market listen to it the markets are always changing so i must adapt my trading to the market changes grow my account organically don’t try to grow it too fast if you start with and take it up to take a couple of grand out and start again build build build i must stand the test of time there’s a selfsabotage in a lot of traders they love the challenge of trading and the climb up the hill eg taking a account to as that’s where the thrill is the climbing up the hill they make a bunch of money and then their subconscious mind says i don’t like this i like the challenge of climbing up the hill so they make silly bets don’t manage risk and eventually blow up just so they can have the thrill of climbing that hill again i must know myself really well to ensure this selfsabotage doesn’t happen to me have an honest chat with myself as this will help me decide what to do and what not to do it’s really important that i don’t beat myself up when i lose money or miss a trade it’s going to happen just get on with things challenge your brain all the time the brain likes order and to file things away but it’s good to throw a challenge in there to keep things fresh whether that’s learning something new about trading options futures ta fa or a new language or taking up sudoku also change things up across my life instead of doing the same old same old even minor things like the way i drive to place i visit a lot take a different route solve problems know its hard to do when starting out but eventually after you evolve into a successful trader you will only focus on the now of trading i won’t care about big wins or big losses or how much money i’m making i’ll just be focused on the next trade and making good trades overall trading mindset daniel’s post and summary we are the casino we have the edges in our favur loses are expected but over trades we walk away with more money trading mindset summary a trading strategyplan is needed accept you can lose every trade taken stick to the plan till the very end of the data set psychology psychology introduction trading emotions risk management and trading steps before each trade psychology introduction how to manage emotions i have no trust in my setups i lost my confidence after a string of losses i’m scared to enter a trade i feel the pressure when i start to understand how market works or when i see other people succeeding i feel the tension of having money on the line not have enough sleep example missed move due to lack of confidence a setup with great confluence presents itself but you doubt your analysis and do not take the trade maybe you overthink a few recent losses or you have analysis paralysis and decide to skip the trade the result is devastating as the trade went exactly as you planned it would go this plant in your emotions for every future trade you can overcome this emotions with a plan and by focusing approaching trading as a business with the proper risk management putting just the required amount of effort psychology psychology in trading focus on charts and trades do not be greedy psychology in trading trading mindset • the greatest and most successful traders find their main reward in the activity of trading itself • if you suffer from fear and greed it’s because you don’t understand yourself most traders win or lose to the same degree that they understand themselves • seeing the market as support mechanism and not as threatening is the critical difference in achieving success so many people are good at charting but not at trading when you have money on the line it changes focus on the chart and trades and the money will come naturally focus on yourself when you are entering a market scared money does not make money you cannot win every trade when you over analyze you’ll become scared of taking trades based on your setup you will always find something that will not make you do the trade psychology in trading trading mindset • emotions and feelings in trading are something that professional traders do not get or block out when entering trades • professional traders feel a connection with the market and have a knack of knowing what is going to happen next information knowledge and edges seem to come out of nowhere • trading is effortless “knowing without knowing how i know” professionals know that they don’t have any control over the market but they start to “know without knowing” even after a positive winning streak if you feel too powerful and unstoppable take a break and come back with a new mindset don’t be too greedy psychology in trading take responsibility for your trades don’t put blame on everybody else than you “my broker told me to go long and i knew it was wrong” “the rsi said to buy and it was wrong” “i knew i should have sold but the wave count was wrong” a key principle in becoming a consistent trader is acting responsibly for your trades a trade journal is a good way to keep accountability and monitoring wins and losses you need to learn from losses analyze what went wrong psychology in trading trade journal you want some form of analysis for the trade you take in order to come back later on this is a key metric for moving forward and becoming a better trader psychology trading emotions how to handle trading emotions trading emotions negative emotions fear depression usually directly correlated to the size of positions we are using and what kind of leverage we are using after a series of negative trading you start to take trades you shouldn’t take not using setups or revenge trading fear is a key emotion to control this ends in a downward spiral of emotions into depression with idea of quitting from trading trading emotions positive emotions greed euphoria after a positive streak of trades you start to believe that the trades will go always better and you leave the position open after hitting the take profits believing you are unstoppable and that you are the best trader in the world you should not have this type of emotion you should be careful when you start to feeling greed when you feel euphoric take a break or reduce your position size trading emotions manage emotions find your center get in the zone find your center try to get in the zone be calm not greedy try to manage your feelings and emotions if you had a bad day or other external feelings they are definitely going to affect your trading be aware of that trading on a mobile phone means probably that you where doing something else trading requires focus and no distractions trading emotions risk management protect your capital stick to your plan no trade is also a trade leverage is a hell of a drug treat it like it don’t use it often and carefully pretend you have a million account would you also manage trades in the same way or you will be more careful do your ta and your plan you know where your risk is and your maximum pain point in order to stop no trading is also recognizing that there’s no trade that have enough probabilities or that the edge is not there don’t let leverage ruin your risk management trading emotions trading steps before each trade find the confluence pick a position size that fits your account execute position size must take in consideration leverage as well picking the right position size will eliminate the fear as you know exactly how you’re going to lose execute you need to take risk without risk you can’t make money trading emotions focus focus mentally and physically eat food that keep your mind sharp do regular exercises do the same activities you will do to master any type of profession entering trades key notes • recognize high liquidity areas • use wide stop loss adjust position size accordingly • find high liquidity places price is drawn towards them • always look for confluence and what is the most probable to happen • laddering into a trade and compounding is very useful • work out what is your preferred strategy of entering a trade • consider a checklist before entering a trade consolidation consolidation above support and consolidation below resistance compounding averaging down laddering different ways how to enter and manage trades swing failure pattern and liquidity places where there is a lot of buyingselling activity trade entry strategy different options how to enter a trade preset market alarm old swing failure pattern and liquidity old places where there is a lot of buyingselling activity entering trades consolidation consolidation above support and consolidation below resistance xbtusd hourly consolidation price breaks consolidation range backtest it and then move up again impulsively for the continuation of the trend what is consolidation consolidation basically consists of a sideway range and an extended one not just a small price correction when price is moving up impulsively you will get little to none sideway consolidation consolidation is just the asset working out to find a fair price supply and demand if the price is expanding upwards is due to the fact that less people wants to sell and more people wants to buy once price reach a level where people is comfortable selling but people fill that the price is still high you have a drop in price consolidation could also be downward sloping more bullish or upward sloping unhealthy and overextended backtest is not necessary but most of the time it happens and is really nice not real consolidation price expanding impulsively price moving in a sideway range consolidation usually a neutral pattern it can break on the upside or downside but one could slightly favor continuation of the trend textbook trading is so different than real trading if you straight jump from textbook advice to real trading you will definitely lose money consolidation forms of consolidation sideways favor continuation to the upside but it is general neutral downward slope bullish best form of consolidation bull flag upward slope still uptrending but does not guarantee a strong consolidation and future corrections might be bigger the price is more overextended xbtusd hourly consolidation there are not so many times sellers can hold up a level before they become exhausted other factors must be considered for the pros and cons of each position market bullish or bearish as it could also be a low risk short generally in an uptrend this should break through resistance consolidation under resistance is bullish if you have a level of resistance and you keep hitting that resistance there’s only so much time people can sell before it goes through to find a new fair level there is real demand and you must go higher to find a new level of supply resistance is broken and then flipped into support for a long trade btcusd weekly consolidation consolidation above support is bearish textbooks classifies consolidation above support is bearish for the same reason of the consolidation under resistance there are not so many times buyers can hold up a level before they become exhausted the end of consolidation and the break down of the support level represent the fact that at this price no other buyers can be found and then a new lower fair value is needed consolidation consolidation counter argument consolidation above support offers a low risk long consolidation below resistance offers a low risk short always look for a higher time frame bias or another technical tool for confluence before entering a trade longing below resistance or shorting above support is like buying into resistances and selling into support not a wise trading strategy do not blindly short when you are consolidating above support nor long when you are consolidating below resistance always look for confluence trends are really strong don’t try to fight them consolidation tips for trading consolidations look at the trends look at the coinciding variables don’t look at one thing in its own look at the bigger time frames to figure out the bigger picture look at the resistances and supports and think what’s most likely given the other variables entering trades compounding averaging down laddering different ways how to enter and manage trades btcusd min compounding averaging down laddering compounding trades compounding a trade is when you are already in one trade and then another setup presents itself in the trade with a good risk to reward ratio and a trade you would take if you were not already in the trade the second trade you take is a trade in itself that you would likely take on its own with compounding you are adding a second position to the setup that is compounding your gains only take the second compound trade only if it is a setup in itself nice confluence and second trade setup once you added the compound trade you can move the first stop loss on the second stop loss in order to end always in profits laddering adds more complexity to a setup but another level of risk as well practice first btcusd min compounding averaging down laddering averaging down trades averaging down adds another trade to a currently loosing position you are essentially averaging down you long price as you are expecting further moves upside first level of support the same technic is appliable to shorts as well only average down if there is a second level of strong support that makes it worth to averaging if after the second entry the conditions of the market change you might try to close the first position at break even the second position might also be bigger in order to close at break even sooner second support if you are a beginner do not average down at the beginning its better to cut out of the trade and take the loss without further risks btcusd hourly compounding averaging down laddering laddering into trades laddering into a trade is when you don’t want to place all your orders in one place it’s almost impossible to buy the exact bottom or short the exact top thus laddering into a position makes sense useful where the entry price could be in a range eg in a fib retracement from and it allows nor to lose the move if the bounce happens early nor to lose a better entry price by averaging the entry price in a defined range it’s different than averaging down as it is a planned setup in order to enter between given levels laddering adds more complexity to a setup entering trades swing failure pattern and liquidity places where there is a lot of buyingselling activity swing failure pattern and liquidity liquidity zones example bigger traders liquidity problem you’re a big trader and you’re trading with multiple million dollars while the price is currently in a low volume range there are options to enter with a limit order or with a market order a big entry size could cause issues if the average volume in the range is on average much smaller than your entry volume if you place a limit order it might never get filled as there are not enough sellersbuyers in that range while if you place a market order it could become a doubleedged sword and your entries will gets filled while price is moving on a longer period is not easy for a big trader to enter at a desired position the best strategy will be to find the place where most of the market orders are sitting for your limit order to gets filled as market orders solely moves the price in other terms grabbing liquidity the largest amount of market orders transactions are going to take place where all stop losses are placed cause most of the people have their stop losses set as a limit order market orders are the orders that actually move the price while limit orders don’t in other terms market orders take liquidity out of the market while limit orders provide it people usually feel safe to place their stop losses in levels backed up by ta by the structure of the price usually belowabove a significant lowhigh point in price abovebelove a consolidation area these are good spot for placing stop losses but also good spot for bigger orders to get filled swing failure pattern and liquidity swing failure pattern • swing failure patterns sfp are attempts to swing belowabove a significant lowhigh but failing to do so not closing above or below the level with a candle close but doing so only with a wick • after an sfp the price can resume a previous trend start a reversal or make a bounce • sfps happens on all time frames the higher the time frame the more significant its effect long positions have most likely put their stop losses below the support level creating liquidity support level liquidity swing failure pattern are also called stop hunts or liquidity grabs breaching a high or a low doesn’t necessary means that a sfp will occurs sfps can either trade into a shortterm retracement or a complete reversal icxbtc swing failure pattern and liquidity how does a sfp looks like visually a sfp candle takes out the high and close back above the previous low the higher the close of a sfp candle is the strongest it is sfp takes out the high and close back above previous low significant and global support level everyone is waiting for a trend change or a bounce previous low sfp happens all the time especially in btc depending on the trend btcusd swing failure pattern and liquidity sfp at a high before a major drop sfps on bitcoin sfp happens all the time especially in btc depending on the trend sfp on the lows for a local trend reversal when bitmex was widely used sfps were more frequent and on a larger scale but now they remain important and quite frequent notice how not all sfp result in a change of the local or global trend context is important btc likes to do a lot of sfps in part because the market is highly leveraged btcusd sfp high provides an invalidation point price ranging at a resistance level swing failure pattern and liquidity from scalp to swing trade using sfps swing failure patterns provide clear invalidation points if price goes back to the level of the sfp then the sfp is no longer valid and the trade setup invalidated if the sfp closes inside the range you can at poc if range is big enough and at the low of the range allowing you to let the trade run if the range is broken transforming the scalp trade into a swing trade with the best setup due to the sfp invalidation point a sfp closed inside the range giving a clear invalidation point swing failure pattern and liquidity how to trade sfps – beginner setup wait for the price to take the highlow wait for a candle close below the previous highlow and back within the local range tp at the bottomtop of the range compound or let the trade run as ms changes note this is a trade setup for beginners without the need to use volume or footprint data but only the price chart swing failure pattern and liquidity how to trade sfps – advanced setup look for trapped traders look for demand to show up look for a change in market structure do not try to catch the knife wait for at least step or for a higher probability trade for step if you wait for step you will have a clear invalidation area stop loss belowabove the lowhigh of the sfp as most probably liquidity has already been taken with the sfp swing failure pattern and liquidity sfp – advanced setup trapped traders for a sfp on a low ● high activity at the lows of the candle lots of high volume on the lower part of the candle selling imbalances red squares on exocharts ● longs getting stopped out decline of open interest ● new shorts opening people turning very bearish higher volume and higher negative delta on the last low selling imbalances orange squares opening on the lower part of the candle decline of open interest longs closing lower volume and delta less negative extra confluence the selling must not be as aggressive as it was on the previous low by looking at volume and negative delta ideally on sfp volume and negative delta must be smaller swing failure pattern and liquidity sfp – advanced setup demand for a sfp on a low ● look for big buying imbalances green squares demand shows up buying imbalances green squares on exocharts ● increase in open interest new longs opening extra confluence volume becomes positive and the delta increases increase in open interest new longs opening up be extracareful as imbalances could also represent shorts getting stopped out so always check confluence with open interest shorts are trapped at the lows as new longs are open since the new longs will likely defend their position swing failure pattern and liquidity sales are bought up by imbalances black boxes with green text this indicates that traders are now more interested in buying rather than selling sfp – advanced setup demand zoomed longs opening while shorts are closing at the same time generate a lot of buying imbalances longs opening while shorts are being stopped out if a trader with long gets stopped out by the new low below the stop loss when he see the price retrace in the desired direction force him to enter a new trade with a market order generating new imbalances in this case due to fomo entering trades trade entry strategy different options how to enter a trade preset market alarm trade entry strategy preset order commonly used by swing traders removes a lot of ‘in the action’ emotions and changing of plan when price reaches level can cause unnecessary losses removes emotions when price is approaching a previously identified level without the possibility of monitoring the action at the moment preset orders can cause unnecessary losses as they get executed without any confirmation trade entry strategy market entries commonly used by swing traders and day traders adds an emotional aspect in trading losses should be less common as you are buying from confirmation you can see price action therefore you are not “hoping” anymore that a move occurs with market entries you see that move is occurring and then you get involved can you deal with “not changing your plan” when price is approaching your level you need to conquer that to use market entries trade entry strategy alerts commonly used by swing traders and day traders allows you to review action make an informed trade once the alert goes off you can review the price action prior to place the order you can check cvd divergences if it is blowing through if it is making a nice bounce etc can you deal with “not changing your plan” when price is approaching your level you need to conquer that to use market entries trade entry strategy daniel’s choice daniel uses alerts at level interesting for trades when alert goes off he can review price action volume delta open interest gc gold correlation stock market action ethereum and altcoins action etc make an informed trade with no ‘hope’ with all the information you can review before entering the trade the margin of error is reduced and the risk to reward ratio is increased as the trade is taken on an informed decision alerts allow daniel to enter only trades with the best setup possible and discard all the others with alerts you can always make informed trades and stop making hopes trades in any case there is always the risk of losing btcusd min trade entry strategy would you put a preset order on the cc in an uptrend will you put a preset order on a well defined cc level and walk away preset order above cc price retraced due to a liquidation run strike through the cc level and the low in a few hours if you had any preset order you probably ended stopped out tight sl if you had placed an alert instead you would have been able to see that the price went strike through the cc without any reaction therefore avoiding you to place a trade entering trades old swing failure pattern and liquidity places where there is a lot of buyingselling activity old swing failure pattern and liquidity the bucketshop drive story i was only twenty when i first accumulated ten thousand dollars in cash and you ought to have heard my mother you’d have thought that ten thousand dollars in cash was more than anybody carried around except old john d and she used to tell me to be satisfied and go into some regular business i had a hard time convincing her that i was not gambling but making money by figuring but all she could see was that ten thousand dollars was a lot of money and all i could see was more margin i had put out my shares of sugar at ¼ of today there was another fellow in the room henry williams who was short shares i used to sit by the ticker and call out the quotations for the board boy the price behaved as i thought it would it promptly went down a couple of points and paused a little to get its breath before taking another dip the general market was pretty soft and everything looked promising then all of a sudden i didn’t like the way sugar was doing its hesitating i began to feel uncomfortable i thought i ought to get out of the market then it sold at that was low for the day but instead of feeling more confident i felt more uncertain i knew something was wrong somewhere but i couldn’t spot it exactly but if something was coming and i didn’t know where from i couldn’t be on my guard against it that being the case i’d better be out of the market you know i don’t do things blindly i don’t like to i never did even as a kid i had to know why i should do certain things but this time i had no definite reason to give to myself and yet i was so uncomfortable that i couldn’t stand it i called to a fellow i knew dave wyman and said to him “dave you take my place here i want you to do something for me wait a little before you call out the next price of sugar will you” he said he would and i got up and gave him my place by the ticker so he could call out the prices for the boy i took my seven sugar tickets out of my pocket and walked over to the counter to where the clerk was who marked the tickets when you closed your trades but i didn’t really know why i should get out of the market so i just stood there leaning against the counter my tickets in my hand so that the clerk couldn’t see them pretty soon i heard the clicking of a telegraph instrument and i saw tom burnham the clerk turn his head quickly and listen then i felt that something crooked was hatching and i decided not to wait any longer just then dave wyman by the ticker began “su…” and quick as a flash i slapped my tickets on the counter in front of the clerk and yelled “close sugar” before dave had finished calling the price so of course the house had to close my sugar at the last quotation what dave called turned out to be again according to my dope sheet sugar should have broken by now the engine wasn’t hitting right i had the feeling that there was a trap in the neighborhoods at all events the telegraph instrument was now going like mad and i noticed that tom burnham the clerk had left my tickets unmarked where i laid them and was listening to the clicking as if he were waiting for something so i yelled at him “hey tom what in hell are you waiting for mark the price on these tickets get a gait on” everybody in the room heard me and began to look toward us and ask what was the trouble for you see while the cosmopolitan had never laid down there was no telling and a run on a bucket shop can start like a run on a bank if one customer gets suspicious the others follow suit so tom looked sulky but came over and marked my tickets “closed at ” and shoved the seven of them over toward me he sure had a sour face say the distance from tom’s place to the cashier’s cage wasn’t over eight feet but i hadn’t got to the cashier to get my money when dave wyman by the ticker yelled excitedly “gosh sugar ” but it was too late so i just laughed and called over to tom “it didn’t work that time did it old boy” of course it was a putup job henry williams and i together were short six thousand shares of sugar that bucket shop had my margin and henry’s and there may have been a lot of other sugar shorts in the office possibly eight or ten thousand shares in all suppose they had of today in sugar margins that was enough to pay the shop to thimblerig the market on the new york stock exchange and wipe us out in the old days whenever a bucket shop found itself loaded with too many bulls on a certain stock it was a common practice to get some broker to wash down the price of that particular stock far enough to wipe out all the customers that were long of it this seldom cost the bucket shop more than a couple of points on a few hundred shares and they made thousands of dollars that was what the cosmopolitan did to get me and henry williams and the other sugar shorts their brokers in new york ran up the price to of course it fell right back but henry and a lot of others were wiped out whenever there was an unexplained sharp drop which was followed by instant recovery the newspapers in those days used to call it a bucketshop drive and the funniest thing was that not later than ten days after the cosmopolitan people tried to doublecross me a new york operator did them out of over seventy thousand dollars this man who was quite a market factor in his day and a member of the new york stock exchange made a great name for himself as a bear during the bryan panic of ’ he was forever running up against stock exchange rules that kept him from carrying out some of his plans at the expense of his fellow members one day he figured that there would be no complaints from either the exchange or the police authorities if he took from the bucket shops of the land some of their illgotten gains in the instance i speak of he sent thirtyfive men to act as customers they went to the main office and to the bigger branches on a certain day at a fixed hour the agents all bought as much of a certain stock as the managers would let them they had instructions to sneak out at a certain profit of course what he did was to distribute bull tips on that stock among his cronies and then he went in to the floor of the stock exchange and bid up the price helped by the room traders who thought he was a good sport being careful to pick out the right stock for that work there was no trouble in putting up the price three or four points his agents at the bucket shops cashed in as prearranged a fellow told me the originator cleaned up seventy thousand dollars net and his agents made their expenses and their pay besides he played that game several times all over the country punishing the bigger bucket shops of new york boston philadelphia chicago cincinnati and st louis one of his favorite stocks was western union because it was so easy to move a semiactive stock like that a few points up or down his agents bought it at a certain figure sold at two points profit went short and took three points more old swing failure pattern and liquidity liquidity • liquidity areas are areas or zones where a lot of trades have taken place or can take place without having a significant effect on its price • liquidity is created on a place where people enter and exit trades where a lot of activity has taken place usually near a point of interest combined of different technical factors fib levels naked pocs market structure • in these places it is likely that many people are having their stops placed slightly below as they are backed up by ta with the knowledge of liquidity we should be able to determine where many traders have most likely placed their stops liquidity run main reasons ● ● ● to fill large position sizes to run liquidity you need a large capital to collect margin for brokersexchanges usually for leveraged positions to force as many people out of the market and create fomo old swing failure pattern and liquidity recognizing liquidity areas • many traders does not take profit and waits for dips to occur to either compound or move up their stop loss as they compound their trades they move their stop losses to the more recent price action and just ride the price until they get stopped out • lower time frames traders use the most recent dips to trade shorter swings or daytrade where would they place their stop losses they place stop losses slightly below areas of confluence for their ta there are different type of traders therefore there are multiple liquidity pools as trend progresses you start building different liquidity pools some bigger than others depending on confluence of ta liquidity runs does not always happen on a trend it’s not a magic formula btcusd old swing failure pattern and liquidity recognizing liquidity areas in a clear uptrend most of the liquidity can be found on the longside as most of the shorts opened during the uptrend has being most probably already stopped out no lower low has been made though most of the people are in their long positions for a while representing a liquidity pool if the uptrend or downtrend is clear and straight without any noticeable corrections there is a good reason to think that liquidity pools has been created during the trend old swing failure pattern and liquidity recognizing liquidity areas liquidity pools could also be recognized by looking at the open interest and the comparison between net longs and net shorts giving the sense of which side investors are more willing to buy if the trend reverse to the downside it has the potential to take out a lot of stop losses old swing failure pattern and liquidity swing failure pattern • in a possible local or global trendreversal scenario eg a downtrend bouncing on a support level swing failure patterns sfp are attempts to swing below or above the significant level but failing to do so with a candle close but doing so only with the candle wick before continuing the reversal • sfps happens on all time frames the higher the time frame the more significant its effect long positions have most likely put their stop losses below the support level creating liquidity support level liquidity • sfp give an opportunity to trade a bounce not every sfp reverses a trend entirely context and confluence are very important swing failure pattern are also called stop hunts or liquidity grabs or even bucketshop drives from story icxbtc old swing failure pattern and liquidity how does a sfp looks like visually a sfp candle takes out the high and close back above the previous low the higher the close of a sfp candle is the strongest it is sfp take out the high and close back above previous low significant and global support level everyone is waiting for a trend change or a bounce previous low sfp happens all the time especially in btc depending on the trend btcusd old swing failure pattern and liquidity sfps on bitcoin sfp happens all the time especially in btc depending on the trend notice how not all sfp result in a change of the local or global trend context is important btcusd old swing failure pattern and liquidity sfp on bitcoin btc likes to do a lot of sfps in part because the market is highly leveraged old swing failure pattern and liquidity how to trade sfps a successful swing failure pattern relies on the following ingredients price breaching past a significant high or low and not closing past that high highest volume near the highlow of the candle trapped trades market structure for confirmation sfps are best to trade at the moment as price can move really fast you can discover an sfp forming by looking at the volume statistics open interest delta volume value areas old swing failure pattern and liquidity spot sfps with volume statistics decline of open interest gets an indication that longs are getting stopped out shorts are opening on the lower part of the candle most of the volume of the candle is in the lower part of the candle high volume on the lower part of the candle shorts orange bars opening on the lower part of the candle decline of open interest volume delta cvd hl old swing failure pattern and liquidity spot sfps with volume statistics – zoomed view as the lows are being challenged it does so on lesser negative delta this shows the move is losing steam heavy selling continues till the very bottom of the low high volume and high negative delta heavy selling into the lows which gets bought up by larger buys indicating buying interest shown as buying imbalances are starting to show up sales are bought up by imbalances black boxes with green text this indicates that traders are now more interested in buying rather than selling sales are bought up by imbalances indicating more interest in buying at the lows we have traders stopped out on their longs and who shorted on the low is now “trapped” in a loosing position this provides fuel to bounce up on the second attempt of taking the low volume decrease and delta increase the move is losing steam volume delta cvd hl old swing failure pattern and liquidity new higher high spot sfps with volume statistics – enter the trade healthy high volume on top of the candles a safer way to trade sfp is to check on statistics and wait for change in market structure for confirmation heavy shorts here once the price goes up they are trapped in a losing position longs that were stopped out are required to bought back in at a higher price and late shorts are required to close their positions this represents more fuel for the bounce up new higher low confirmation of the ms change we have heavy volume and negative delta but the low is never taken volume delta cvd hl old swing failure pattern and liquidity summary key points for a successful sfp and a continuation of the trend for this example uptrending traders being trapped in losing positions or being stopped out increase in volume and positive delta increase in open interest volume at the top of the candle indicators key notes • there are lagging indicators no too useful and leading indicators • daniel only uses indicators at last to add confluence • oi is extremely helpful health of the movetrend • funding can provide useful information but is dependent on context • vwap is brilliant indicator it incorporates price and volume a strong sr line indicators main indicators explained divergences divergence types you need to know open interest and funding how to determine if a move is healthy vwap useful indicator that incorporates price and volume indicators indicators main indicators explained indicators indicators notes • a lot of indicator are just lagging indicators eg moving average or rsi • lagging indicators are calculated from the last close price • you cannot predict what can happen next only reacting from what was already happened thus entries are given once the move has already started • lagging indicators are used for confirming a trend and its strength you can use lagging indicators eg moving averages as leading indicators by predicting that price may reject from a ma in the future but all calculations for this type of indicators needs past data before it is plotted and are only based on past data every indicator might give false signals use them with caution no lagging indicator must be used solely as a leading indicator in the sense of predicting future price they are just a representation of what happened in the past xbtusd hourly indicators bad strategy example – macd crossover quite diffuse bad strategy buying where macd blue line is crossing over the signal line red line and selling when signal line is crossing over macd usually when the cross happens the move has already started sometimes the price move back after a crossover move already started price retrace right after macd crossover move already started macd crossover can be useful to confirm and add strength to a bias of a move when a crossover happens you already missed the lion’s share the largest part of the move the same applies to moving averages deathcrosses strategy also lagging indicators indicators

with all these indicators indicators average true range atr • average true range gives the average move from a lookback period usually • atr will be higher when there is more volatility in a market • specifically useful for stocks or forex • can be used for stop loss orders or price targets eg if you place your sl inside of the atr value you are more likely to be stopped out as the price could move averagely of a atr value you can never go wrong by referring to the average true range at the start of the day there are so many ways and strategies that the atr could be used for in crypto market is less useful daniel doesn’t use atr for stop losses or targets anymore btcusd indicators average true range – example the average moving on the chart is the atr in the example is so one could trade with targets from the daily open or trade with a sl larger than the average true range for a chart and a swing trade perspective high volatility volatility is decreasing you might want to change the atr range from to days for example to get the average move on the last days just be aware of the atr when you are defining stop losses and targets but don’t use it alone daniel doesn’t use atr for stop losses or targets anymore indicators average directional index adx adx values adx can help determine how strong a trend is and in which direction it is going adx indicator comes with lines • • •

divergences on the wave • reliable for spotting tops and bottoms • it can be used for buying and sell signals eg just look for a red candle followed by greens on the bottom side for a buy signal but daniel doesn’t use it for signals awesome oscillator can be used on all time frames from minutes to weekly very similar to macd don’t use it alone to find divergences or topbottoms daniel doesn’t use it for buysell signals but only to determine the strength of a move btcusd min indicators awesome oscillator – example awesome oscillator is useful to spot divergences or confirmations about uptrending or downtrending moves awesome oscillator is useful if used alongside divergences daniel think it’s better than rsi for that in comparison with macd readings and points will be very similar but daniel think awesome oscillator is better also it doesn’t come with macd lines which are pointless bearish divergence in an uptrend possible local bullish divergence downtrend is gaining momentum confirmation indicators advanced rsi • better than standard rsi you can add a second rsi on another time frame eg to have htf vision even on min chart • it has visual indication of oversold and

indicator as volume can precede price actions divergences on obv are usually stronger than the ones on macd awesome oscillator as they represent volume money coming in and out of the market never use this indicator alone always look for confluence btcusd min indicators obv cci – example look for divergences and patterns the indicator changes color depending on the cci when the line is green it

𝑽𝒐𝒍𝒖𝒎𝒆 • the indicator has bars of four colors each color has a specific meaning and shows how market responds to a change in volume • green both mfi and volume are up it means that more and more traders join the market in the current direction in other words it points to a strong trend ideal scenario green bars in a row on chart • brown both mfi and volume decline also called “fade” it signals that traders are hesitating and don’t want to continue the trend anymore as a result it’s not recommended to join the trend several brown bars are a sign of a potential reversal • blue mfi increases but the volume declines a spike in price may be shortlived and precede a change in the trend blue bars appear at the times when newbies enter the trend but professional traders know that it’s already too dangerous • pink mfi is diminishing but the volume is growing also called “squat” it reflects an increase of trading interest and an active fight between buyers and sellers after one of the sides wins price will likely make a big move breaking support or resistance levels the mfi however can’t be used to determine the direction of the breakout search for ‘market facilitation index

alligator jaw is the blue line the teeth is the red and the lips is the green • where the three lines are together alligator is sleeping there is no clear trend which represent a notrade zone you might wait for the lines to widen up alligator opens his mouth before entering a long or short trade • the market is bullish when the green line gets on top and bearish when the blue line is on top

buysell signals when lines cross each other or the triplet change side greenblue on top three lines together no clear trend the more wide are the lines the more strength has the trend green line on top bullish indicators volume profile • very useful when used in confluence with horizontal levels • if a horizontal level is on a low volume node it will likely not hold as well • if a horizontal level is on a high volume node it has a higher probability to hold btcusd indicators volume profile – example look for confluence and confirmation of horizontal levels if they are also on a highvolume node there is a higher probability that the level holds as supportresistance daily level on a low volume node probability of holding it is lower no rejection daily on high volume node you can just look at the price movement to find where the volume is if the price goes up or down quick without consolidation the volume profile will be lower indicators divergences how to determine if a move is healthy divergences divergences notes • specific divergences are seen across indicators oscillators such as macd rsi stochastic rsi obv etc • this chapter is about divergences in general without focusing on a specific indicator • use divergences as extra confluence they are the last thing daniel watch before taking a trade • people that trades only using divergences lose money after a sideway period consolidation if you get a sudden pumpdump the following move will always have bearishbullish divergences as the following wave will have less momentum this does not mean short never trade from divergences alone use them to confirm a bias that you might have for extra confluence don’t get obsessed and don’t focus only on indicators divergences bullish divergences reversal • on bullish divergences price makes a lower low while oscillator makes a higher low • bullish divergences are used only to confirm a possible trend reversal on an important support • bullish divergence might

interest and funding open interest and funding notes open interest funding can be used to identify how “healthy” a trend or a move is is an important fee to be aware of extremely useful when trading a macro trend it can influence price can be used to identify sideway patterns or try to find how a sideway range is going to break less important than open interest but still helpful example example btc billion open interest was a level of resistance for some time funding majorly effected breakdown of the descending triangle in btc open interest is really helpful in crypto as lot of traders doesn’t have that knowledge instead in stock market more or less all traders have the same knowledge a high funding now is different than a high funding from some time ago you always need to be aware of the context open interest and funding open interest price volume open interest rising increasing increasing rising decreasing decreasing declining increasing increasing declining increasing decreasing market meaning bullish high buy interest strong uptrend new long contracts are opening bearish buy interest drying up weak uptrend existing shorts closing or being stopped out bearish high sell pressure strong downtrend new short positions are opening bullish sell pressure fading out weak downtrend existing longs are closing or being stopped out if volume and open interest are both increasing then the current price trend will probably continue in its present direction if however the volume and open interest are declining the action can be viewed as exhausted and that the current price trend may be nearing an end open interest and funding open interest • with prices moving up in an uptrend and total open interest increasing this shows that new money is coming into the market new longs which is considered bullish • if prices are rising and open interest declines the movement up is only likely to be caused by shorts covering therefore money is leaving rather than entering the market once shorts stop covering the trend is likely to reverse back down • if price is in a downtrend and open interest is rising this shows that new money is coming into the market with aggressive short selling which is considered bearish • if total open interest is declining along with declining prices this is considered bullish websites to check for open interest exocharts coinalyze tensorcharts open interest and funding funding • in crypto funding has an effect on price • perpetual swaps do not have an expiry date and they need to keep the exchange price near the spot price so when it start to reach extreme differences funding is used to make traders want to close or open positions • if funding is positive people is attracted to close their short to receive the funding longs pay shorts • if funding is negative people is attracted to close their long to receive the funding shorts pay longs with large amount of volume and higher volatility in the recent bull market funding has less impact indicators vwap useful indicator that incorporates price and volume vwap volume weighted average price vwap • vwap is a support and resistance line below the level expect resistance above the level expect support • vwap is very impactful because calculated by incorporating price and volume statistics • at vwap level there is a lot of transacted volume and it does benefit scalper that trade with bigger sizes eg institutions whales etc • really useful for scalp trades in general • can be used on all time frames from a very high time frame for swing traders to a very low time frame min for scalp traders big sizes scalps are difficult to trade when there is small volume eg in a sideway move therefore big traders prefer to trade them into a level with a lot of converging volume where the order gets most probably filled vwap can be yearly monthly weekly daily session the most used one and also ‘anchored’ btcusd – yearly vwap resistance vwap htf vwap high time frame vwap is a very strong supportresistance line when price is above vwap it is “above value” and when it is below it is “below value” position traders that are trading rarely they are not likely buy when price is above value support weekly vwap is more impactful on frequent traders it is touched more times daniel doesn’t use vwap on a really high time frame like the yearly but you can use it also for this scenario btcusd min – session vwap vwap session vwap more impactful when it is aligned with another confluence level such as fibonacci or poc resistance as vwap is based on volume statistics trading in confluence with volume levels pocs vah val is extremely powerful support when you have vwap in confluence with fibonacci levels in a trending market it becomes a very strong sr btcusd min resistance anchored vwap cyan taken from the start of an impulse down vwap anchored vwap anchored vwap could begin from a particular and specific point in time support resistance anchored vwap allows to see the average price and volume statistics from a pivotal point in time eg the coronavirus drop or the last impulse updown anchored vwap yellow taken from the start of an impulse up volume is also spiking during the impulse up volume spiking a strategy for the anchored vwap can be to select a point in time when the volume suddenly and significantly increased and maybe translating in an impulse in price as well useful tool especially for scalp traders fibonacci key notes • all fibs should always be pulled from left to right • use negative fibs fib extensions and fib expansions

fibonacci confluence by taking different pulls from different levels if there is an area with several fibs lining up this creates a stronger level of support to find fibonacci confluence you need to take at least different fibonacci pulls and then search for fib levels that match up close together thus creating a stronger fib level example pull from the overall low from where the move got impulsive and from the local fibonacci pull look for levels very close together if they are spread out that’s not confluence region with several fib levels lining up offers a strong support in an

pulling from the overall high to low for resistance or the overall low to high for support the trade will be very crowded and you will likely not do a good trade a better strategy will be to consider

because they are not traded so often by real traders fibonacci fibonacci levels level color ffffff ffffff ffffff ffffff ffffff ffffff ffffff ffffff ffffff ffffff ffffff to apply the levels you need to find the historical trend seeing the pivots that’s used and forecasting future trends using the levels in the retracement low to high or high to low you need to see reaction around to confirm that bots are working on the price movements you can also add expansion levels such as etc wavesbtc fibonacci reaction at fibonacci – example in the retracement low to high or high to low you need to see reaction around to confirm that bots are working on the price movements the definitive confirmation that bots are working is when price react also to the other levels as well the retracement must not react to higher or lower levels than multiple touches usually of a level usually depletes the sellingbuying capacity of bots generating a break upsidedownside pull pivot mouse click pull pivot mouse

notes • time plays a crucial role in determining which waves of a move are linked together • fibonacci time allows to estimate a correction duration given an impulse • if a correction happens too quick in comparison to the preceding impulse it’s likely to mean that is only the first part of a bigger correction and there is still more to come • fibonacci time is useful with harmonic patterns and elliot waves theory in particular corrections usually last or more with the impulse move updown eg days up – days down fibonacci time in combination with harmonics and ew theory with a nice price analysis it’s a killer feature fibonacci time can be used on any time frame but the higher the better or more you can get the right price direction but you don’t time correctly your entry you’ll

fibonacci speed resistance fan notes • time plays a crucial role in determining which waves of a move are linked together • fibonacci fan are extremely useful for determining when the slope of a move has become overextended • fibonacci fan can be used to determine the time taken and the angle of a retracement fibonacci fan in confluence with fibonacci time and fibonacci retracement is really powerful in trading view it is called ‘fib speed resistance fan’ many traders forget the importance of time and angles given by geometric tools like fib time and fib fan fibonacci fan is an underappreciated tool while its extremely powerful fibonacci fan fibonacci fan values level color fibonacci fan values are the main one used in fibonacci retracements based on the fibonacci sequence

old channel it might come into play again later • sideways channels are more respected than sloping channels • bull and bear flags regularly for channels • deviations are normal – know when to adjust them and when not • duplicating channels gives you potential target for the move • fibonacci channels are best used on htf parallel channels part parallel and sideways sloping channels parallel channels part partial declines or rises in pattern and channels parallel channels part duplicating channels trading range and over and under channel fibonacci channels part fibonacci channels fibonacci extension channels and fibonacci long term channels parallel channels parallel channels part parallel and sideways sloping channels parallel channels part parallel channels notes a deviation is when price breaks outside the channel but fails to maintain it and come back inside it a parallel channel or range is formed when there are at least touches at the bottom and at the top you will likely see the price ranging inside the channel neutral price action until the channel breaks touch touch parallel channels are a good way to remove biases on charts because you simply look for long at the bottom and short at the top of the range touch deviation a partial rise or partial decline is when price gets near the top or bottom of the channel without hitting them therefore you can think of partial rises as a sign of weakness and partial declines as a sign of strength touch do not trade your bias just trade the chart it’s given to you partial decline can be interpreted as a sign of strength breakout do not expect the range to be hit at the exact top or bottom but you will likely see deviations from the high or low and partial risesdeclines parallel channels part parallel channels – volume and breakouts coming from an established downtrend it is more probable that the channel will break on the downside touch touch volume decreasing while in the channel touch usually while price stays in a parallel channel you want to see a decline in volume like what happens on a flag a parallel channel is technically a neutral pattern as the price can break up or down but it is more probable that the channel breaks on the overall trending direction forming a structure like a flag usually when breakout occurs volume noticeably increases on the contrary during deviations the volume stays low touch volume increasing at breakout to distinguish between a deviation and the real breakout you might look at the difference in volume increased volume in channel breakout following a simple rule of continuation probabilities that channel breaks on the overall trend direction versus the opposite are vs volume volume is a key metric that you need to consider while trading channels parallel channels part parallel channels – trades deviations if correctly detected can give great entry opportunities in this case for a short once the channel is reclaimed always trade the parallel channel till it breaks when the breakout of the channel is on low volume it means it is likely to be just a deviation recognizing deviations can give a good opportunity for a trade entry once the price comes back inside the channel trading the break in the overall trend direction yields better results coming from an established downtrend it is more probable that the channel will break on the downside if you trade all the tops and bottoms of the range you must be aware that you will loose one trade at the breakout that’s why it is preferable to trade in the direction of the probable break lost trade at breakout parallel channels part parallel channels – basic targets strategy for moves and breakouts to the upside at channel top at extension of the range after hits move sl to the channel midline range added to breakout a basic channel target strategy will be long the bottom of the range short the top of the range take profit at the opposite side of the channel channel range once is hit move the stop loss at the middle line of the channel take profit can be set taking a measured move of the channel adding this distance to the breakout direction at the extension of the range range added to breakout for moves and breakouts to the downside at channel bottom at extension of the range after hits move sl to the channel midline instead of using the measured move at breakout it’s better to use horizontals fibonacci extensions or other tools to get a more accurate price target for be aware of the context the middle line can be a take profit region as well see next strategy parallel channels part parallel channels – day trading strategy max – chart if the middle line is taken move stop loss at breakeven and optionally compound the trade tp a good day trading channel target strategy will be long the bottom of the range short the top of the range take profit of profits at the middle line of the channel once is hit move stop loss at breakeven no losses optionally if the price closes above below the middle of the channel confirming it compound the trade with a smaller entry eg of the initial trade in order not to risk all profits taken strategies for day trading parallel channels are very different from strategies for swing trading parallel channels on htf if the middle line is taken move stop loss at breakeven and optionally compound the trade tp often the mid point of the channel offers a considerable resistance that’s why take profit on the midline is essential after if price retraces back to the low or top you placed your initial entry you can optionally compound your trade but it’s not suggested more than to of the profits as a partial risedecline is a sign of weakness parallel channels part parallel channels – swing trading strategy if you didn’t close the trade but only took a major part of the profits you can optionally compound the trade once the middle point is reclaimed a good swing trading channel target strategy will be tp long the bottom of the range short the top of the range take major part of the profits at the middle line of the channel you might consider to completely close the trade or take a high percentage of the profits eg if after midline tp you keep the trade open is suggested to aggressively trailing stop losses put stop loss not only at breakeven but even in profit tp in a swing trading channel the midline is a target and an aggressive take profit region trade might also be closed because the midline is a very significative resistance in a swing trading channel you might keep holding positions for days weeks months or even years depending on channel take profit at the midline of the channel as it is a high resistance compound or open a new trade btcusd daily resistance parallel channels –
