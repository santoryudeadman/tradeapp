copyright page of introduction to order flow my name is michael valtos and since i have been trading for banks jp morgan and commerzbank as well commodity trading houses cargill and edf man and for myself while trading for the investment banks i learned how to get information out of the market and how to trade off that information into a profitable position when there is an opportunity to earn a significant return relative to risk you get into a position while trading at commodity trading houses i learned to think how commercial endusers think you are always in a position just by being in that business whether or not you chose to hedge a position in the futures market while trading for myself i learned to take low risk high return trades i do not try and capture every random move in the market what i look for is what i like to call “stress free trades” which to me are low risk entries that have high profit potential i have enough stress in my life i don’t want trading to add to it order flow analysis is a visual representation of market price movements constructed by recording the volume traded on the bid and the offer as opposed to just looking solely at price the value in order flow analysis is in instantly confirming market tops and bottoms when they form determining where changes in supply and demand have occurred and providing insight into market psychology and market conditions here is an orderflows chart compared to a traditional candlestick chart page of normal bar charts only show the open high low and close they don’t show how much traded on the bid and offer they don’t measure how strong the buyers and sellers were orderflows charts tell you that new traders are always trying to find the holy grail when it comes to trading a way to trade that will allow them to pull money out of the market as if it is their own personal cash machine a secret order to the markets based on price indicators and moving averages however when it comes to the market there are no secrets nothing in the market is certain hard work practice sound money management and most of all discipline are what will make a trader profitable just as the alchemists used to try to turn lead into gold mathematicians and computer programmers come up with new indicators to try and predict the next market trend gann enthusiasts and elliot wave practitioners throw stones at me when i say the market is not ruled by mathematical formulas not much has changed over the last years of trading except the advent of computers making the dissemination of market information faster traders still look at the open high low close and volume in almost the same fashion as they did years ago traders still look at the ticker tape although now they refer to it as order flow computers have made tracking the trades as they occur much easier and allows for the data to be analysed and deciphered the japanese have a saying “consult the market about the market” which means that when trading the market we should pay close attention to the market movement is telling us rather by swayed by information outside of the market either fundamentally or technically in volatile times a fundamental traderanalyst can be exactly right about the market but they can get run over in the short run a long term trader needs to be aware of what is happening in the market in the short term it isn’t just the retail traders that get caught off side sometimes it is the big institutional hedge funds not watching what is happening in the market in the case of clive capital the fundamentals were still bullish the technicals were something that rarely happens the market moved standard deviations none of that stopped the market page of would order flow analysis have helped clive capital i don’t know but i do know that when i see smoke i look for a fire and if there is a fire i run for the exit i don’t wait around for the fire to be put out i know what you are going to say “warren buffet says to buy when everyone is selling and sell when everyone is buying” you have to fade the crowd mentality while that is indeed true most of the time you have to get out when the signs are there if you are an american visiting iran and people are chanting “death to americans” it is your best interest to get out there granted that is an extreme example but you should get the point if the market is telling you to get out you should get out page of order flow is not another form of technical analysis per se technical analysis is the study of prices as they appear on a price chart and it assumes that current prices represent all known information about the market the problem with that is that traded prices don’t just represent intrinsic facts about supply and demand numbers prices also take into account people’s expectations about the future order flow analysis is a dynamic realtime way to view the market’s evolving and changing market state its primary benefit rests in its unique ability to see a clearly who is in control of the market based on market generated information as it happens the key elements of order flow are price traded bid volume traded ask volume when these elements are displayed in an order flow chart traders who understand order flow will be able to identify the market’s areas of strength and weakness every market moves up or down based on the interaction between supply and demand traditional charting techniques or analysis do not accurately allow you to analyse understand and interpret the fighting occurring between supply and demand order flow charts allow you to dissect supply and demand balance in real time as it is happening you will understand which side is in control and be prepared to respond when it changes as we are taught in economics prices are a function of supply and demand and both supply and demand are affected by people’s emotions markets move based on people’s needs and more importantly their future expectations of needs the problem is that a traditional bar chart does not accurately measure nor reflect the emotions of the market participants order flow analysis allows a trader a quick read on changes in supply and demand by analysing the price movements of the volume traded on the bid and ask a trader is can confirm a trend continuation or reversal early on and gauge market sentiment by determining how aggressive the market traded in the past it was difficult to read and understand order flow however advances in technology and the exchanges have made reading and following order flow accessible to anyone who is interested to learn it page of the advantage of order flow analysis is that it shows the trader a very clear visual image of what is happening in the market it provides a deeper insight into the market when compared to other types of charts the market signals that show up in the order flow are not available in other forms of bar charts now you can see and determine for yourself how aggressive the buying or selling in a bar really is it is a fact that institutional traders are the first to act when a big move is about to happen because they have the money to move the market and they are often the traders that give the market the push it needs to get started moving in the past there used to be a trading floor where independent traders who paid big sums of money to be in the trading pit would yell and scream while trading with brokers who were executing the institutional trader’s orders when a sizable order would go into the trading put the independent floor traders could make an educated guess if the order would move the market and trade accordingly today there are no trading pits there are no people screaming to execute their trades in a trading pit where you can see which players are buying and selling trading is done electronically now however electronic trading is anonymous and quiet you need to be able to read the footprints the institutional traders leave behind in the market roughly of traders lose money why losing traders make trading decisions based on indicators such as rsi stochastics macd moving averages etc all these indicators are derived off of price i find it is better to just look at price and how the market participants react to price price is an advertising mechanism it is there to get you into a trade losing traders are your edge in the market it is their money you have to take in order to do that you have to approach and read the market in a way that is different than what the of losing trader do many traders are led to believe that they can blindly follow a mechanical system that is based on a mathematical formula and back tested on years of data to show its profitability but what they fail to understand is that it is not mathematical formulas that move markets you do not need an advanced degree in applied mathematics to understand and make efficient use of order flow even financial experts don’t know all the answers nobody does order flow analysis is a tool to page of help a trader make the right decisions to spot weak highs and lows to spot aggressive buying and selling and much more other traders think they can just entrust their money to a “black box” computer program and sit back and make monthly withdrawals from their brokerage account they think they can make the money successful traders do with an off the shelf computer program they do not want to put in the hard work necessary to develop the skills to become a successful trader a trader has to learn how to trade not learn how to take a trade what i mean is a trader has to learn how to read the market learn how to anticipate what the market will do based on what it is telling you and go with it if you talk to any aspiring trader they will tell you all about the latest indicator or moving average crossover they are using to trade that is not trading that is just taking a trade so how does one make money trading by listening to what the market is telling you and using strategies and taking trades that give you an edge by being more knowledgeable than most of the other traders it is not as difficult as it looks the key to successfully trading futures is to stack the deck in your favour this is done by trading when you have an edge order flow gives you that edge most traders page of don’t pay attention to order flow one of the benefits of order is that you don’t have to analyse every tick most numbers can be disregarded what you are looking for are numbers that stick out and then ask yourself what is going on in the market be realistic in your thinking and approach to the market at any given moment there are literally thousands if not tens of thousands of traders watching the market with the intention of finding a profitable trade to take you don’t need a crystal ball to know when they are coming you just have to get in before everyone else does time may prove me wrong but i worry about the state of the markets when all the big trading firms only want to hire traders with advanced math degrees it doesn’t take a phd to understand why a market moves i have always felt that trading is like most professions in as much as the accumulation of knowledge is concerned markets do not always do what they are supposed to do trading futures is a business just like any other it is easy to be dazzled by the stories of the million dollar bonuses most people trade the markets for one reason to make money a successful trader has a business plan trading plan when to get in and out a budget trading capital an operating plan money management and most importantly has discipline and will use that discipline to stick to their plans and make money they recognize when it just isn’t their day and stop trading for the day they know when to be aggressive and when to back off tomorrow is another day futures markets are open every weekday successful traders trade on their own terms and conditions when the conditions are ripe they go in for the trade if not they wait successful traders approach trading as a business like any professional would we all want the big money as a trader when we watch basketball we all want the amount of money michael jordan made or what lebron james makes now around million a year the fact is those guys are superstars and the best at their trade look at lesser players like ray allen who is basketball’s all time leading point shooter he earns million dollars a year he comes on late in the game and shoots and score point attempts he specializes is one thing but he does it page of extremely well he has become a master at it trading is the same way understand the basics and become a master in an aspect of trading every mother wants their child to grow up to be a doctor why because they know doctors make very good money but i am sure among the doctors you know the ones who make the most money are those who specialize in one area and are experts in their field of training like the cardiologist or neurosurgeon some of the highest paid professionals are specialists the point here is that in almost every field you can make good money by specializing in a certain area most people who are new to trading do not take the time to become experts in an area of trading they jump from indicator to indicator when they experience a loss these new traders then think they know it all when it comes to the market but the fact is they don’t know much their problem is they haven’t taken the time to learn about the market and what makes it move retail traders often place way too much emphasis on finding the absolute “perfect” system to trade with the right balance of technical indicators professional traders make their trading decisions without relying on indicators and cluttered charts global political events monetary policies economic reports and other external fundamental forces are key factors in what drive price movements these factors cannot be measured with an oscillator or a moving average knowing how to read the order flow what is happening in the market as these fundamental forces appear give you an edge over other traders who are simply following indicators or oscillators which lag price if i achieve my objective through this book i will have taken you to a new level of understanding the market that most traders never think about or understand as with any way of trading the markets one must proceed with baby steps when starting out make sure you understand what you are doing before jumping in as there are risks involved when you start trading with new ideas and concepts enough of this preaching let’s get on to the heart of the matter and begin to learn how to use order flow to become a profitable trader page of benefits of trading order flow order flow shows the market psychology what is happening in the struggle between buyers and sellers there is no other form of analysis that shows you how aggressive traders are being in the market among other things beginning traders often spend their time coming up with trading systems that show amazing winloss ratios of winning trades profit ratios far exceeding profit to every loss and generating millions of dollars when back tested so they open a trading account and promptly lose all their money they think the markets are logical when in fact it is psychological it is the emotions of the market participants that dictate their buying and selling not mathematical formulas a market doesn’t reach a high and turn because the rsi says the market is overbought it turns because the sellers have overwhelmed the buyers or the buyers have disappeared institutional traders make their money by being on the right side of the market when it moves these traders work for banks large corporations hedge funds and governments they can’t afford to be wrong on the market very often because it will ultimately cost them their job and cushy lifestyle at times these traders may be privy to information not readily available to the general trading public these traders are able to see major trends before they take place and position themselves accordingly they don’t rely on technical indicators and black box systems they use the black box between their ears called their brain what is great about order flow is that their actions are recognizable in the volume after their trades this enables the order flow trader to understand what is happening in the market before other traders are able to notice what is happening order flow helps to remove the randomness from trade decisions traders who use technical indicators are basing their trading decisions on combinations of fast and slow moving averages there is no logic behind it why should a day moving average be that much better than a day moving average technical indicators just curve fit past results to make the results look pretty we have all seen the charts showing a perfect macd trade giving a buy signal at the low and sell signal at the high but you don’t see the charts where you would be chopped up page of every other bar buy sell buy sell buy sell etc order flow will help to keep you out of the choppy markets order flow enables a trader to make accurate trading decisions it is easy to make money when the market is trending beautifully in one direction but the market doesn’t always do that the market trends stops continues turns direction etc most technical tools lag the current price when market behaviour starts to change you need to quickly adapt order flow shows what is happening in the market now so that you can capitalize on the opportunities as they happen order flows shows you why prices turned at a level order flow shows you how aggressive the market participants are order flow provides and objective means to quantify risk every trading book says to “cut your losses short and let your winners run” while great in theory the reality is when you cut your losses short you also cut your potential profits technical and fundamental traders struggle to know when to cut losses short there is no technical indicator that says you can cut a position short here or there order flow shows you exactly where to get out of a trade when it is not going as planned you are not left to guess if a trade is working out or not you will know before you get in additionally order flow shows you when there has been a change in supply and demand which will help you determine if you should indeed cut your losses short order flow allows for more structured and less stressful trading all traders look for low risk trades but i take it a step further and look for low stress trades we all have enough stress in our life there is no reason why trading should add to it order flow allows you to know the areas to get in and the area where you will know if a trade is not working out page of examples of order flow in everyday life nontraders think trading futures is some black art that is only for those on the inside and if you try to explain what order flow analysis is to them they will think you are some sort of voodoo witch doctor actually we are all order flow traders in real life without realizing it in our everyday life we are confronted with decisions about value of things whether it is deciding to fill up your car with gasoline at shell or texaco based on price or reading about a sale for the latest hand phone we make decisions based on based on our perceived value of a product relative to what we are willing to pay for it and how desperately we need it when you buy a car you go to a car dealer with an idea of what the car you want to buy is worth and what you are willing to pay for it the dealer knows what the lowest price is that he can sell it at you and the dealer negotiate back and forth until both of you are happy and agree on a price within the negotiation one of you had to be the initiator in the trade either the dealer came down to the price you wanted to pay or you went up to paid the price the dealer was offering to sell the car to you women don’t realize but they are on the forefront beneficiaries of trading and market forces because the fashion business operates just like the market trends in fashion are constantly changing skirts get shorter certain fabrics become more popular as do colours clothing stores watch their inventory and anticipate changes in fashion trends to make sure they are adequately stocked with items where there is strong demand and they can charge high prices the stores lower prices on items when the demand is waning and they can still make a profit on it if a store does not change its position quickly enough and go down on price on items with dying demand they will be forced to sell those items at a loss your body temperature fluctuates during the day most of the time your temperature is within a normal range of to degrees celsius body temperature tends to be at its lowest during the morning and it is at its highest during the afternoon many outside factors such as exercise eating consuming alcohol or catching a virus can cause your temperature to rise outside its normal range if it reaches a certain level and stays there for a prolonged period you know you are not healthy page of the markets are the same way only instead of temperature you are dealing with prices if a price is too extreme it can be a sign of the market being unhealthy when external factors are added to the normal routine the market can and will react to it just like your body temperature it doesn’t always rain when the sky is cloudy nor does a bright shining sun indicate warm weather weather predictions depend on such factors as the time of year high and low pressure areas barometer readings etc the markets behave the same way just because a chart indicates something should happen doesn’t mean it will happen just because fundamental analysis leads you to believe prices should go up that they will you need to look at what is actually happening in the market to know what is happening in the market page of orderflows software there are several different order flow software vendors in the market i tried most of them the prices range from a few hundred dollars to well over the scary part is people actually spend and more for trading software thinking it will make them a better trader it is tempting when you see their slick sales pitch i mean who wouldn’t want to trade hours a day and make if you could guarantee me a day profit trading for only hours a day sign me up unfortunately there are no guarantees in trading and it takes work sometimes a lot of work i created the orderflows software so that reading and understanding order flow is easier based on what i feel is important to the trader i spent the better part of three decades trading all different sizes of orders i traded more than my share of thousand lot orders i know the impact certain types of orders and trades have on the market i know what it is like to trapped in a position and need to scramble to get out i know what will happen to the market when i step in with lots to buy and create a low of the day there are a lot of market intricacies that the current order flow software just did not highlight or explain i found a coder and gave him my instructions and the result is the orderflows software when creating the orderflows trader software i wanted the indicators to be displayed automatically on the chart the beauty of order flow analysis is that it can be applied to any timeframe rangeframe or volumeframe with consistent results orderflows trader software can be used on its own or in conjunction with whatever method you use to analyse the market and make trading decisions i purposely wanted to keep the chart clean and uncluttered so that it is easy to see setups as they are happening the only squiggly line on my chart is the high and low for session page of the orderflows software runs on the ninjatrader trading platform i chose this platform because for a retail trader it is probably the best trading platform available many futures brokers use ninjatrader software ninjatrader offers a free version you can run the orderflows software on a free version of ninjatrader if you want to and execute your trades through your own broker supplied trading front end i get my data from kinetick the quality is excellent and the price is affordable page of interpreting order flow when an institutional participant like a hedge fund wants to buy contracts of soybeans they won’t just put in a market order to buy contracts at the market they have to think of the market impact an order of that size could cause there are many ways they can work the order to minimize market impact but the fact remains the same when the trades go through it will show up in the tape and can be interpreted in the order flow order flow’s value is not in predicting exact tops or bottoms but in confirming market tops or bottoms as they form and providing insight into the market’s psychology at the most basic level of market structure it is buyers demand and sellers supply who move the markets it is not mathematical formulas markets don’t move because the macd or rsi reached a predetermined level what causes markets to move is when demand exceeds supply or supply overwhelms demand indicators lag prices when the market makes a high there are no indicators which will say sell until well after the market has turned lower what causes markets to turn and change direction is a little more complex markets turn when the last buyer has bought or the last seller has sold markets turn when there price is considered cheap and big buyers start to come in and scoop up supply at those low price levels conversely when prices are rich and sellers want to sell as much as they can high prices there are times it is just obvious you would not believe it order flow charts show you these levels i use order flow to understand the behaviour of the market everything i do is to understand the behaviour of other market participants i try to understand the position the other trader is in are they long and wrong has a big player decided price is too cheap or expensive has someone tried to push prices higher or lower and failed all of these questions and more can be answered with order flow imbalances in supply and demand can be detected with volume analysis once you start watching the way orders flow into the market by reading the tracks or footprints left behind by the traders it will become clearer where the market is going markets are not predictable all the time but page of at certain times the direction the market will be moving will become pretty obvious order flow is a discretionary way to trade even though it requires discretion it doesn’t mean that you trade it without rules every situation is a bit different what you look for are patterns that occur over and over they may not be exactly the same but the pattern of the order flow is recognizable are aggressive buyers coming in is a high weak etc order flow allows you to identify price action that repeats in a general sense how the order flow flows in the market while the market activity is never exactly repeated by knowing how to read the market activity as it happens enables the trader to gauge the current state of the market and form an opinion of what will happen there is always a constant struggle between buyers and sellers buyers want the price to go higher and sellers want the price to go lower so you need to ask yourself “who is in control” the market is always giving clues as to who is in control by observing the flow of trade can a trader understand who is in control of the market i spent three decades watching and trading futures based on order flow the same concepts still apply from years ago or even years ago as they do today when the price of something is too cheap people buy it and it becomes a low when the price is too high people sell it and the high is made what order flow provides the trader is the ability to stay out of the market when there is no reason to trade it allows the trader to see both sides of the market what is trading on the bid and what is trading on the offer and gives the trader a far better view of the current state of supply and demand than the ordinary trader will struggle to see i have met a lot of floor traders in my life and some of the best have told me they get a “feel” for the market while this may have been true during the days of open outcry because you can see and hear the trading going on based on the noise level and hand signals flashing back and forth unfortunately now the open outcry trading floors are closed and everything is traded electronically it is hard to get that “feel” on the market anymore even when i think about it having a “feeling” on the market has gotten me into more trouble than i care to mention page of however i believe that anyone can learn to “read” the market reading the market allows you to know where buying and selling is going on or drying up reading the market allows you to know where solid highs and lows have been made traders make money by being positioned in the direction the market is moving they are long when the market is going up they are short when the market is going down it sounds simple yet so many people lose money in the market because they are short when the market is going up or long when the market is going down by reading the order flow a trader can determine the direction of the market if the market tells you to go long then buy and go long and when it starts to go down then get out of the position or get short let the market show you the direction it wants to go rather than trying to predict where the market will go order flow charts can be used in any futures market that has sufficient volume traded daily there are different strategies to employ for different market conditions markets that have high price volatility have large price ranges with varying volume ie currency futures have certain characteristics that are inherent to them while markets that have low price volatility but high volume ie interest rate futures have their own characteristics however many of the same underlying principles discussed here can be applied to both types of markets page of reading an order flow chart when comparing prices on an order flow chart you have to do it diagonally from the left to up on level on the right not horizontally futures markets no longer trade in a fixing in that they when it gets to a price like all the people that want to buy it and sell it at that price can the way the markets work is traders put in bids and offers and people buy and sell accordingly the market will move from bid offer to bid offer to bid offer when you look at the example above when the market was bid offered at lots were sold into the bid and lots were bought from the offer when the market was bid offered at lots were sold into the bid and lots were bought from the offer when the market was bid offer lots were sold into the bid and lots bought from the offer when the market was bid offer lots were sold into the bid and lots bought from the offer at when the market was bid offer lots were sold in the bid and lots bought from the offer when the market page of was bid offer lots were sold into the bid and lots were bought from the offer when the market was bid offer lots were sold into the bid and lots bought from the offer the market did not go bid because the volume on the bid is this is called unfinished business the market tried to go higher and was bid and in this case lots sold into it but no one bought from the offer at the reason this is referred to as unfinished business is because the market has a tendency to come back to that level the market did not go offer because the offer volume is if the market went offered at and traded it would show a volume other than there is always a bid and offer in the market unless the market is limit big or limit offer that is how trading is done someone wants to buy so they work a bid someone wants to sell so they work and offer when someone is tired of waiting they go to the market on their order or they just get in at the market they buy at the offer price or they sell at the bid price order flow charts allow you to compare what traded on the bid side and what traded on the offer side order flow charts monitor not just volume and price but more importantly on which side of the market the volume happened the bid side or the offer side it is this information that gives the order flow footprint charts their color green for aggressive buying more trading at the offer price and red for aggressive selling more trading at the bid price black prices are considered neutral on the next couple of pages is a quick glance at orderflows trader software generated charts don’t worry about understanding all the notations now it will make sense to you once you read through this guide page of page of page of the importance of price price is one of the most important pieces of information in trading price is what makes people want to buy or sell a commodity the change in the price of a commodity is the determining factor between a profit or a loss for traders the goal for traders is to buy when the price is low and sell when it is high that is common sense trading so why do so many people lose money trading when the price of a commodity starts to move there needs to be a big enough force behind it to overcome its opposing force stated another way there has to be more buyers than sellers for the price to move up or more sellers than buyers for price to move down the market participants cause the market to move with their buying or selling activities how price moves out of an area can determine if the impending move will be strong or weak just because priced moved does not mean it will continue in that direction knowing how priced moved is important in understanding the health of the market if it is strong or weak how often have you seen price action on a chart like the one on the right it is easy to look at a chart and see a long down bar and think “everyone is selling” do you want to sell also the market can continue down you see it all the time in the market however it is not uncommon for a long bearish down bar on a chart to be immediately followed by a long bullish up bar but until you look at the next component volume you can’t judge how strong the move is and more importantly who is behind the move page of here you have a big down candle followed by a big up candle followed by a big down candle again when you look at the first big down candle you say sellers are in control which is not wrong but if the sellers are in control why did the market turn around so fast it just did a complete degree turn and even took out the high of the red down bar when you look at an order flow chart you have a better understanding of why the market turned around so fast at point a due to massive passive buying and why that when the market subsequently tried to sell off again it met support around to level at point b previous level of aggressive buying imbalance market rotations like this happen quite regularly as you will see throughout this book markets move because of the changes in supply and demand we all know that when there is more buying than selling prices go up when there is more selling than buying prices go down while it sounds simple page of that is the textbook theory but it is actually a little more complex than that markets move up because there are no major sellers taking profits yet the major buying should have already occurred early in the move by institutions so until institutions start selling their positions out the market keeps going higher if institutional players are still expecting higher prices they will absorb selling that comes into the market but they won’t be buying just to support the market they are buying until they are sure all the supply at these lower levels has disappeared markets may move down not just because there are more sellers than buyers it could very well be that there is just not enough buying to support the market on its way down in a down market there is very little to hold up the market in terms of bids as a result prices drop this is one of the reasons markets drop much faster than they go up when the market is moving the best trades are to buy when buyers are buying and sell when the sellers are selling in the days of pit trading locals used to stand in the pit all day and could see when the institutional money would come into the market to move it they locals joined in on the moves this is not rocket science the trading pits were filled with guys with only high school degrees or even college degrees it doesn’t take a phd to know that when the market is moving is a good idea to move in the same direction prices go up until buyers become unwilling to buy buyers run out of buying power buyers are overwhelmed by sellers prices go down until sellers become unwilling to sell sellers run out of inventory sellers are overwhelmed by buyers a trader needs to be able to understand what kind of activity is moving prices if sellers are pounding into bids and clearing them out your position can get run over pretty fast especially depending on who else is page of there selling you have to determine if it is better to be a buyer in a market going down or a seller only an order flow chart can give a trader the insight into why the market turned around not all market turns will be as clear cut as the example above but when they are you need to be able to react quickly to take advantage of the opportunity page of the importance of volume volume is also an important part of a trader’s arsenal but also is perhaps one of the least understood until now most analysis of volume has been on total volume order flow breaks down volume by the amount traded on the bid side and the amount traded on the offer side now traders can determine if the buyers were aggressive or passive and if the sellers were aggressive or passive price and volume looked at together will help the trader determine the current state of the market and if supply and demand is imbalanced traditionally volume has been looked and analysed after the fact not as it is happening generally volume would be plotted along the bottom and would be used to confirm a trend technical analysts will tell you that volume is a measure of the strength of the current price trend the problem that i always had when looking at volume in this simplistic already rudimentary way was that you couldn’t differentiate between volumes traded on the bid versus volume traded on the offer this is page of especially important on bars that look neutral where the opened and closed at about the same level if you look at volume by itself its meaning has little value because you don’t know where price is relative to the amount of volume traded once you start to look at volume relative to price you begin to understand the momentum within the market volume is perhaps the most important piece of information when determining the strength of a trend markets move up down and sideways over time and price in an uptrend traded volume should be increasing on the offer side this shows that buyers are being aggressive and buying all the available supply the market has to offer in a down trend traded volume should be increasing on the bid side this shows that sellers are getting rid of their supply to passive buyers in a sideways trading market the volume on both the bids and offers should be absorbed by the marketplace like a sponge order flow volume analysis tells us the amount traded at a price during a time frame when you start to look at the volume that has traded at subsequent prices you can determine if the market is strong or weak traditional charting methods only measure volume in regards to time if you look at volume traded at price you get a much clearer picture of what is going on in the market page of when you look at point a the internal volume trading in that bar screams at you that the buying is done there is a big buying imbalance at the high and lots over the time periods at and lots buying imbalance at then the market sold off and there is lots selling imbalance traded on the bid at a stacked imbalance of levels of selling imbalances between and a few more selling imbalances appear in that bar the market tried to rally on the next couple of bars but could not get past the stacked selling imbalance before finally selling off dramatically it is pretty amazing how stacked imbalances act as great levels for the market bounce off of they are great areas for low risk entries generally speaking when volume is low and the market is moving up you know that the market is weak this could be because the institutional participants are not buying in the up move because they know that higher prices cannot be sustained based on supply and page of demand unless the institutions are participating in the up move it probably won’t last very long if it is just retail money moving the market with little volume that is not a good sign for a trend to be down there would need to be institutional participation which would show up in the volume there is ample supply in the market so there will be strong volume on the move down as the sellers will be offloading their supply to buyers during down trends you will see small temporary up moves within the down trend watch the move and check the volume institutions have been bearish the markets and selling you won’t see them buying into a weak market just because price bounced a little bit when you notice the volume start to diminish on a down trend the selling pressure by institutions is subsiding while the market may continue to fall be aware that it could quickly turn and rise momentarily due to lack of supply for a market to turn from a downtrend to an uptrend buyers would need to come in and take control from the sellers which usually equates to a rise in volume page of the importance of delta delta is a term used by order flow traders to define the net buying or selling that took place for a given bar it is calculated by using tick data and seeing who initiated the trade either the buyer or seller if more sellers initiated the trade then the delta is considered negative if more buyers initiated the trade then the delta is considered positive the reason delta is important is because you can determine the strength of a trend based on volume as price trends higher you would want to see positive delta which is a sign of buying driving the price the opposite would be true for a market trading lower there should be sellers driving the price which would translate into negative delta visually delta measurements look like this delta delta for the bar max delta maximum delta in the bar min delta minimum delta in the bar page of cum delta cumulative delta of the day cum deltavolume cumulative delta divided by volume volume volume for the bar cum volume cumulative volume for the day if a market is consolidating or range trading the delta number generally will be a low number depending on the market it could be less than when normally it is over and will bounce around back and forth between positive and negative there will be times when the delta is very close to zero which is a sign that there is an almost equal amount of volume trading on both sides of the market this is called absorption and is usually a place where supply and demand can shift and a new trend start delta is also relative to the type of chart and what part of the trading day you are looking at if you have a minute chart up the delta can be very low just because there might not be much trading going on the same can be said if you are trading in the evening or early morning sessions before the old regular trading hours start those times of the day generally have little volume trading so delta will be small if you are looking at a volume emini sp chart and the bar has a delta of that would be more important than a minutes chart where the total volume traded was lots and the delta was you have to take the delta in context to what kind of chart you are using page of cot commitment of traders i am not talking about the commitment of traders report put out by the cftc which is a breakdown of open interest in futures markets that report has its own uses not covered here with order flow analysis footprint charts each price bar has a cot or commitment of traders in it this is the price level within a bar that the most traded volume occurred on both sides where the most trade was committed within the bar remember order flow analysis looks within the bar with a regular bar chart or candlestick chart there is no way of knowing this the orderflows trader software package will put a box around the cot for easy visualization on your chart page of with the cot you can see where the most volume occurred whether it was near the top middle or bottom the cot is important because it gives you clues as to what the market forces were up to within the bar it can tell you within the bar where demand has overcome supply and vice versa as one side will be dominant the cot tells you something that traditional bar or candlestick charts cannot depending on where the cot is you can get a quick glimpse where the most activity was which in turn can give you hint to anything out of the ordinary in the above chart the cot occurred near the low of the bar which closed on near its high when the most volume trades near the low of a bar that closed higher it is usually a sign that there are strong passive page of buyers in this case we see strong passive buying as well as buyers willing to buy all the supply other sellers were offering in the above example at point a the cot occurred near the top of the bar and the bar closed lower this tells me that there were interested buyers near the high but they were met with just as many interested sellers and the sellers took control of the market and moved it lower at point b the market tried to rally and lost steam as the buyers just dried up as evidenced by only lot trading at the high then a selling imbalance just below the high of the bar and the market sold off and closed on its low the cot appears near the bottom of the bar and there is a big buyer that was aggressively sold into causing a selling imbalance just above the cot there is also a big number on the bid that was sold into the market participants just ate through the bids and page of closed on the low of the bar also there was not much buying in the bar when i see the cot near or at the bottom of a bar that closed on its lows that is usually a sign or the market going lower since there were active sellers to move prices lower generally speaking when the cot is in the middle of a bar it is market neutral if it appears at the top of a bar and the bar closed lower that is a bearish sign as a lot of trade was facilitated at the high but the market couldn’t trade higher all the buyers were met big sellers if the cot appears at the bottom of the bar and the bar closed higher it is generally a bullish sign as all the selling pressure was met with buyers there are many different combinations of cot locations in the example above the market is just sort of going nowhere it would go up a couple of points then come down a couple of points the cot’s are appearing mostly in the middle of the bars then at point a all of a page of sudden there are some big new passive sellers that put in offers at the and level which were bought up but the market couldn’t go higher and actually closed lower and there were a few selling imbalances near the low of the bar the cot is near the top of the bar yet the bar closed lower this is my clue that the market is primed to go lower which it does the cot by itself is not an indicator but can be used for confirmation of a move i like to look at the cot location in a bar when i am lost on the direction of the market if the market is just range trading i look to the cot for some sort of sign as to the direction or potential direction page of different types of buyers and sellers every book on futures trading says that the market is a zero sum game for every winner there is a loser this is true but not everyone trades futures for the same reasons it is a common belief that everyone is trading the futures market to make a profit that is not always the case even though the overwhelming majority of trading is done to make profits futures trades could be put on as a hedge when someone is long an underlying commodity they sell the futures to hedge their price risk farmers have been doing this for centuries as a form of insurance if the futures position loses money they don’t worry so much just like with life insurance you don’t feel bad when you don’t die and your family can’t claim the money there are many other reasons people enter into trades in the futures markets which are not for the sole purpose of making money in and of itself or without directional bias a trade can be part of a statistical arb trade where a trader is longshort different markets trying to take advantage of miniscule pricing differences a trade can be part of a spread between correlated markets there are many reasons too numerous to mention in this book alone but each reason helps to explain why a market can facilitate trade on both the bid and offer and not move much so as you can see there are several different types of buyers and sellers being able to distinguish between them will help you understand what the market is showing you as to its direction what does it mean when there is an aggressive buyer it means that someone bought the offer they paid the market price to get into our out of a position what does it mean when there is an aggressive seller it means that someone sold into the bid they sold at the market to get into or out of a position what does it mean when there are passive buyers it means they bought at the bid price an aggressive seller sold it to them what does it mean when there are passive sellers it means they sold at the offer price an aggressive buyer bought from them page of generally i find that aggressive buyers and sellers are those who need to get into a position we may not know the reason these participants are getting into the position so aggressively but when they are it leads to imbalances which is a sign of a market getting ready to move passive buyers and sellers are less aggressive but just as important they provide support and resistance to the market place they are the buyers at the low and sellers at the high when a market cannot get past a big passive buyer that is a signal the market can be ready to turn page of aggressive participants in the old days when a market would move without a clear reason brokers would say “there are more buyers than sellers” or vice versa however the problem with that is that it is just not true there are not more buyers or sellers what you have is different types of buyers and sellers there are aggressive buyers and sellers and there are passive buyers and sellers every bar is made up of both aggressive buyers and sellers as well as passive buyers and sellers throughout this book you will see the words “aggressive buyers” and “aggressive sellers” when a trader is being aggressive they are hitting the bid or lifting the offer they are essentially paying the market price to get into the market aggressive participants trade into passive participants resting limit orders aggressive buyers and sellers are represented by selling at the bid or buying at the offer they are willing to sell or buy at the market price because they want out of they want in an aggressive buyer is someone who is will to pay what the seller is asking an aggressive seller is someone who is willing to sell at a price the buyer is bidding page of when you see big aggressive buyers or sellers come in to the market you should watch what the market does afterwards does the market rally does it sell off does it hesitate does it get absorbed when there are big aggressive buyers the market will typically rally when there are big aggressive sellers the market will typically sell off if the market does not do what it is supposed to do the contrary move is likely to be magnified it is easy to confuse aggressive buying and selling with buying and selling imbalances the difference is for every trade there is either an aggressive buyer and passive seller or an aggressive seller and passive buyer one participant will be aggressive and one will be passive a buying or selling imbalance doesn’t have to happen an imbalance occurs when the buyingselling ratio is above a certain level there is a whole section devoted to buying and selling imbalances in this book page of by itself just looking at aggressive participants and trying to determine market direction is a bit difficult because in every trade there is an aggressive participant and a passive participant you have to take the information in context to the rest of the market of course every buyer has to be met by a seller and that is the subject of the next chapter passive participants page of passive participants passive participants are those who are willing to sit on the bid or sit on the offer to get into a trade they are not moving their price to get into the market they have decided that at a particular level they want to buy or sell and are willing to sit there until they get filled passive participants will enter the market on limit orders aggressive participants will trade into passive participants limit orders passive buyers and sellers are represented by limit orders they let the market come to them so in the above picture at lots were bought by passive buyers people just sitting on the bid lots were sold by passive sellers it was bought by aggressive buyers at lots were bought by passive buyers the people that sold it to them were aggressive sellers because they had to go down in price to meet the bid price lots were sold by passive sellers at sellers who were working an offer at a passive buyer is someone who is willing to buy at his bid price a passive seller is some who is willing to sell at his offer price page of in other words when you look at the market quote bid offer bid for contracts offer for contracts the contracts on the bid are passive buyers the contracts on the offer are passive sellers if someone one is working a bid for contracts at and decides to just go ahead and buy his contracts at the market price of he is now consider an aggressive buyer the opposite is true if a seller working an offer at decides to sell at the market price of he has become an aggressive seller while most traders like watch what the aggressive participants are doing keeping an eye on the passive participants can be extremely profitable as their levels can often times signify major turning points in the market passive participants are usually institutions who can help set the price highs or lows when price gets too cheap they step in and buy everything when price gets too high they sell as much as they can when you see huge numbers that traded on the bid side at a low or huge numbers traded on the offer side on a high these are usually good indications of institutions passive participants i like to see big passive participants at highs and lows rather than in the middle of a move page of page of the importance of aggressive and passive particpants when the market starts to move it takes market orders to push the price higher or lower limit orders don’t move the market for the market to go up traders have to buy at subsequently higher prices for the market to go lower traders have to sell at lower prices the market has to work through levels of passive buyers or sellers every trader knows that certain price levels are important in terms of supply and demand by seeing the volume that traded at that particular level and even how the market reacted around the level a trader can determine if the level will hold or not many trading “gurus” teach that declining volume always precedes a market top or market bottom as if it is an immutable law in school book theory yes it may be true but in reality it is not always true as evidenced in the order flow chart you can have heavy selling at market bottoms and market tops almost as if the market hits a wall and turns around in the opposite direction page of think of these levels as lines in the sand you do not want to cross that level without good reason or else you will find yourself in trouble a trade looks more appealing if there is a big volume number that supported the market than just an average number these trades don’t happen every day but when they do they are pretty reliable indications of market bias at least in the short term page of imbalance levels the volume traded at a price level in the market can either be balanced or imbalanced when a level is out of balance there are proportionally more buyers or sellers at that level most commonly used ratios are and what does it mean when there is a buying imbalance it means that the quantity bought on the offer is greater than a set ratio than the amount traded on the bid usually or it may not be just one buyer it can be several but what is important is the traded quantity is greater on the offer than the bid what does it mean when there is a selling imbalance it means that the quantity sold on the bid is greater than a set ratio than the amount traded on the offer usually or it may not be just one seller it can be several but what is important is the traded quantity is greater on the bid than the offer here is what imbalance levels look like on an orderflows chart page of when an imbalance happens in supply and demand that is where trading opportunities appear when big buyers come in and the market can’t rotate up then look for a change in bias the opposite is true when big sellers come in and the market can’t sell off be on the lookout for a change in bias the beginnings of a trend as well as ends of a trend are often marked with market imbalances caused by aggressive participants this shows that participants are anxious to get in the market and large volume enters the market and prices move quickly page of stacked imbalance stacked imbalances are important levels to look for when initiating a position when you get stacked imbalances of or more on top of one another it is a good sign of strong pressure in the market and that the market will continue in that direction it acts as support and resistance the reason stacked imbalances are good levels of support and resistance as they are levels where the market was aggressively sold into a bid or an offer was aggressively bought into in theory these stacked imbalance levels are levels where participants aggressively wanted to get into the market so when the market retests those levels the same participants may appear again page of the beauty of stacked imbalances is that they make great entries for low risk trades quite often price will retrace back into a stack imbalance zone before continuing in the direction of the stacked imbalance the stop placement is very easy it is just outside of the stacked imbalance zone literally a tick or two outside the stacked imbalance at point a there was a stacked selling imbalance and the market sold off from the middle of the imbalance zone before rallying through it at point b there was a stacked buying imbalance the market traded down through it before rallying back up where it hit point c and could not get past that level and then turned and sold off depending on where you put your limit order to get in the position i like to put my entry limit order at the middle and last price in the stacked imbalance zone then i place my stop one and two ticks outside the stacked imbalance zone this trade has an average tick stop a small loss at point a and point b page of but point c was a nice winner the market sold off points to not bad considering your entry was at and during the course of the trading day there can be many stacked imbalances there will be some that work out beautifully but most will fail but for a trade where you are risking tick to ticks with a potential profit of ticks and more it is worth the trade i like to look for these trades on longer time frame charts like a minute or minute chart page of orderflows software has a feature that will find stacked imbalances in a market and draw on your chart the support and resistance levels generated by the market for buying imbalances a green zone will be shown on your chart for selling imbalances a red zone will be shown on your chart page of trapped buyers and sellers trapped buyers and sellers are short term market participants that bought at or near the high or sold at or near the low and the market has not followed through for them they are trapped in a losing position the market has turned against them and they need to cover their position to get out you can see trapped sellers when the imbalance numbers are at the bottom or a tick or two off the bottom and the market is not going lower and instead turns and goes higher and the price bar closes higher there is a saying in the markets “someone has to sell the low” and it is usually the trapped sellers that do trapped sellers are usually the last people to sell in a move page of you can see trapped buyers when the imbalance numbers are at the high or a tick or two off the high and the market is not going higher and instead turns and goes lower and the price bar closes lower trapped buyers are usually the last people to buy in a move up these buyers will have to turn into sellers which adds to supply causing prices to move down trapped traders are those caught in a trade that moves against them and are hoping and praying that the market will quickly come back to their entry level so they can get out trapped traders usually find themselves on the wrong side of the market pretty quickly and are under immediate pressure to cover losses once price moves against them page of when you are able to find trapped buyers or sellers there is usually a good short term trading opportunity while it may not signal the end of a long term trend it can identify market turning points in the short term trends can start once the trapped traders are shaken out of their losing positions and aggressive participants start to be active candlestick bars and traditional bar charts cannot show you trapped buyers or sellers you need the ability to look inside the bar to determine what is actually going on in the market when you look at the order flow you have solid clues the market is ready to pop higher page of order flow charts can be applied to longer term time frames of course not all trades will be as beautiful as these trades but as you can see the profit potential is quite large just catching a few of these moves a year can really make reading the order flow footprint charts worthwhile here are another set of charts this time in the the eurocurrency futures contract page of ok i know it is a stretch to say trapped traders with lots will turn the market and cause a trend in the opposite direction rather what is happening is that the market sentiment in general has changed the market cannot carry through and the last buyers on a high or the last sellers on a low have gotten in page of absorption markets are always looking for a level for two sided trade to take place a price level where both buyers and sellers can participate back and forth without moving price very much this is called absorption these are the price levels where both buyers and sellers are happy to transact major volume with each other you will see big size trade into the bid and big size trade into the offer the net difference between the two will be small relative to the amount of volume that traded a traditional technical analyst may think of absorption as consolidation but there is a difference and that is volume a market may consolidate because of a reason other than what is happening in the market there may be a fed announcement so trading volumes have decreased and the ranges get small this may look like absorption there may be a holiday so volumes are low because traders are on vacation it could be the day before the nonfarm payrolls number comes out these events and others can lead to consolidation before price moves absorption on the other hand is a level where you see heavy volume go through but on both sides of the market the bid side and the offer side this is where inventory changes hands the big money long term commercial players don’t come in and butcher the market they trade their size where there is size that can be traded big money moves markets but usually it is not just one player it might be a few big players some medium size players and a bunch of smaller players the place where they meet and do the majority of their trading is called an absorption level because that is the level where a lot of volume occurred but the market did not get affected by it both buyers and sellers were happy page of the origin of any price move is where supply and demand starts to move out of balance this is where the low risk high probability and high reward entry levels are prices start to turn higher when demand exceeds supply price turns lower once supply exceeds demand when the market starts to move out of absorption levels there are some great trading opportunities the only way to see absorption is by looking at volume footprint charts absorption can occur anytime in the market when it occurs it is relative to what happens afterwards major trends do not happen immediately after each other the start of a major trend is often seen after a period of absorption where one side of the market is able to build their position up as absorption dries up price is free to move in the direction of aggressive buyers once all the supply has been removed from the marketplace the market is free to move higher without much resistance absorption can be present at the end of trends and profit taking mid trend when absorption occurs it indicates demand is being met by new supply at market highs or supply is being met by new demand at market page of lows basically price is not able to move any further as new supply or demand appears in the markets what is good about absorption is that it can be regarded as a sign for a breakout move as the buyers and sellers fight for control of the market once the transfer of supply or demand has taken place price is likely to move away from value one caveat with absorption you tend to see absorption occur within the last few minutes of the day this does not necessarily mean new supply or demand has come into the market it can likely be attributed to day traders closing out their positions before the end of the trading day and hedge funds trying to execute orders as close to the closing price as possible page of initiative activity institutional long term players dictate trends and when the volume they wish to trade cannot be satisfied at one price their perception of fair value shifts and price starts to trend this is called initiative activity to move a market outside of a value area it takes large orders it takes institutional players retail traders just do not have the financial resources to move prices for extended periods outside of value areas value area if the market is trading above value as a result of buyer pressure that is initiative buying if the market is trading below value because of selling pressure that is initiative selling you have to understand where fair prices are and understand where unfair prices are once you start to move away from fair prices it is important to know why is it initiative activity are buying taking the initiative to move prices higher or if the market is moving lower are sellers taking the initiative to move the market lower when the market breaks out of a value area but there is no strong buying or selling pressure then you look for responsive activity which is in the form of limit orders for example when you buy a house you will usually submit a bid if the price of the house is valued at million and you like the house but you are not in a hurry to buy you may submit a bid of the seller might then lower his price to because he is a little more motivated to sell but you are firm in your bid eventually the seller gets aggressive and lowers his price to your bid and sells it to you you are a responsive buyer the price of the house has moved below the value area you are buying below value but not aggressively page of breakout trades can happen in either direction of value what is important to note is if there is any responsive activity to stop the move and push the market back into the value area how do you determine what the value area is the most common method is with market profile it is the area where of the day’s trading occurs the value area is based on what time period you decide page of once you learn to recognize the players institutional or retail by the order flow footprint you can determine what type of activity is going on page of candlestick charts order flow candlestick charts are a simple visual form of tape reading and price action and were created by the japanese a few hundred years ago they show you were the market opened the low the high and where it closed for the period traders try to predict future price movements based on candlestick patterns that have formed there are all sorts of patterns with colourful names that traders look for abandoned baby dark cloud cover hanging man gravestone doji and many more sometimes the patterns are reliable other times they are not i think the reason candlestick charting has lost some of their effectiveness is that markets have evolved over the last several hundreds of years market participants and their activities have changed japanese candlestick charting was developed in an era when there were no institutional traders or day traders or high frequency traders this is not to say that candlestick charts are useless in today’s trading environment because they are not they give a quick visual colourful page of representation of the market which is useful to most traders i do use candlestick charts in conjunction with order flow charts to help keep me abreast of the short term direction of a bar on the chart it is important for me to know where the bar closed in relation to its open actually a normal bar chart can also show that information but aren’t as colourful the essence of candlestick charting is the relationship between the opening price and closing price in simple terms a long green i have mine set to green instead of traditional white because my charts are white background candlestick bar indicates buying pressure however you cannot understand the magnitude of the buying pressure without looking at the order flow even with candlestick charts it is difficult to know if the buying will continue or stop a red candlestick indicates that during the bar the market closed at a lower price than it opened candlestick charting and also traditional bar charting methods fail to show is what really happened during the bar you can see a big white candlestick which is a bullish candlestick and conclude that buyers were aggressive while that may be the logical conclusion to make as obviously buyers were in control to cause the bar to close much higher than it opened you don’t know how much in control they were or if their control waned at the end page of the order flow chart is on the left and the candlestick chart is on the right in the run up in price there are five green up candlesticks but in the fourth and fifth candlestick you start to see aggressive selling come into the market as seen in the fourth bar at by the lots traded on the bid at and lots traded at also the bar had a negative delta of which is a sign of selling pressure so while the bar still closed higher than it opened there was more selling than buying in the bar on the fifth bar volume was less and the market couldn’t go any higher and you already had a sign in the previous bar that sellers were now coming into the market i would be hesitant to buy at this level and more inclined to look to be a seller imagine a soccer game where the score ends you read the score line and see the final score and think the winner had a nice easy game all the way but if you actually watched the game you might see that the first minutes the game was evenly matched as both sides failed to score but over the last minutes the winning team scored a goal and that caused the other team to change their style of play to try and tie the game but winner scored yet another goal a few minutes later and it was now with minutes to play the losing team yet again changed their tactics and gave up another goal the score was then at this point the other team just played to run the clock out and gave up yet another goal and the match ended up if you just look at the final score you will think one thing but when you dissect the match you see that it wasn’t until late that one team really asserted it dominance just looking at a candlestick form on a chart you may miss the essence of how the candlestick was actually formed did buyers or sellers become more dominant did one side give up did one side become trapped candlestick charts do not show that order flow charts do if you were going to pick a winner in the soccer game it is easier when the score is than when it is candlestick charts are a useful tool by themselves but when partnered with order flow they help create a powerful analysis method one of my favourite trades occur when i see buying or selling imbalances in the wick areas that run contrary to the candlestick type to try and trade in the direction of the candle for example a red page of candlestick with buying imbalances near the top in the wicks and selling imbalances in the body i look to short for example the bar there were buying imbalances at the top near in the wick and selling imbalances in the body the opposite is true with a green candlestick i look for selling imbalances in the wick and buying imbalances in the body what is happening in the bar is the market sells off first aggressively before aggressive buyers come in and really take control of the market page of the bar a selling imbalance in the wick and buying imbalances in the body the next bar at the market went down and tested the low of the previous bar before rallying on the bar the setup works on a variety of charts short term like the minute charts in the example above and even longer term like a range chart page of page of what kind of charts can be used with order flow i use a variety of charts daily in my analysis of the markets i am not tied down to one particular type of chart to do so would be foolish there are different types of participants in the market from the extremely short term to very long term if you decide to base all your trading decisions on one type of chart say a minute chart you are missing out on the bigger picture there are three types of charts i like to use range charts volume charts and time charts even though all three types of charts have the same variables of price volume and time it is how each chart uses them that makes it different and useful my first choice of chart to use is a volatility based chart also known as range charts where volume and time are variables the market doesn’t care about every minute time period or minute time period or whatever time period you set your charts to you want to see where the market rotates with a range chart bars are created when price moves a range bar chart will have a size of bars price would have to move ticks for a new bar to be created you can set the amount of bars to whatever you like new bars will only form when price is moving if price is not moving or stuck in a range within the bar a new bar won’t form until it moves outside of the bar when price breaks outside of the set range of the bar a new bar will form the second choice of chart type that i use is volume based charts where price and time are the variables you can choose any amount of volume for this type of bar each bar will have roughly an equal amount of volume that is traded in that bar and when the volume exceeds the set amount a new bar will be formed when i say each bar will have roughly an equal amount of volume for example a volume bar one bar may have lots while the next bar may have this happens when trades are split between bars there will be times when it takes a lot of price levels to facilitate a trade of lots and there will be times where lots can be traded without moving price this is valuable information that can be used in making trading decisions the third type of chart that i look at are time based charts where price and volume are variables this would be something like your normal page of minute chart however to get a handle on the importance of volume in trading you need periods where volume is trading if the time period is too short there may not be enough volume traded to understand what is happening in the market one minute charts is too short five minutes give a better look on the market thirty minutes is good for longer duration trades that can last for days time based charts are the way the majority of traders choose to view the market you will see many examples in this book using time based charts in addition to range and volume charts this just shows you how order flow footprint charts can be used in various ways and how the market can be broken down given a choice between range based charts volume based charts and time based charts i would choose range based charts followed by volume charts followed by time based charts i am also interested in are daily weekly and monthly charts i find previous highs and lows are important to look at and keep in mind when trading today those are levels where the market stopped and turned due to supply and demand when the market revisits those levels i watch to see if they are accepted or rejected again page of high frequency traders hft and scalpers there has been a lot of bad press about high frequency trading over the last several years some lawmakers even want to ban the practice a majority of the bad press you hear about hft’s comes out of the equity markets where there are multiple exchanges trading the same issues most hft’s in equities work multiple orders across multiple exchanges so there can be a chain reaction when an issue trades on one exchange resulting in quick price movements in other related exchanges this explains why a majority of people think high frequency trading is a way for some traders to front run orders since a computer can react much faster than a human the important function of hft’s in futures markets is that they provide liquidity in the markets i won’t get into the intricacies of hft’s but suffice it to say that high frequency trading firms have become the new scalpers in the futures market in the days of pit trading locals would stand in the pit and make markets all day long trying to buy on the bid or sell on the offer holding positions for seconds or minutes now there are computer programs that essentially do the same thing the programs work bids and offers across multiple futures markets hft’s don’t have a clue what is going on in the world and don’t care these programs are reacting to market movement before they occur all other traders react after they occur hft’s don’t take positions and ride them as long as they can by their very definition “high frequency trading” they are in and out of the market many times a day scalpers are traders who trade in the extreme short term they originated from the trading pits where they would generally try and at least capture the bidask spread however in today’s trading environment scalpers do not try to capture just the bidask spread yes they will take just a one tick profit if that is all the market will give them but usually they will try and make ticks if they can usually though scalpers will get out of the market once they feel momentum has stopped a more apt name for scalpers would be short term day traders hft’s and scalpers do use order flow analysis they look for areas where orders will come in and try and jump ahead of those orders that page of is why sometimes it appears that these guys are front running your trades when all they are doing is simply analysing order flow you are not competing against hft’s or scalpers or the mythical group of traders known as “them” you are competing against yourself hft’s do not control the market they are reacting to market conditions and trading opportunities as they occur instantaneously there are much bigger participants in the market moving in and out daily there are banks pension funds hedge funds commercial producers asset managers and more you don’t know what their position is you don’t know why they are getting in or out of a position what is important to you is how you are able to analyse what is going on in the market and profit from it page of institutions and their use of algorithmic trading i mentioned earlier that on the basic fundamental level what moves a market are buyers and sellers when you break it down i suppose the one thing that moves markets is money and it’s not a little bit of money it’s a lot of money who has the money to move markets hedge funds banks and commercials for simplicity sake i will refer to these players going forward as “institutions” in different markets they have different identities in commodity markets it may be a big commercial company like cargill adm or unilever a company involved in the production or consumption of a commodity in stock indices it may be a fund management company like profund or fidelity a company that invests in the underlying stock markets in the bond market it may be a player like western asset management corporation a company that invests in global government bonds institutions generally are always involved in the market in some way as it is inherent to their business even if they don’t have a position that can be considered a position being on the side of the institutions is important because they make the trend they have the money to make the markets move up or down on a sustained basis let me be clear when i talk about institutions i don’t mean any one player in particular it is their cumulative effort that moves the markets not only do they have the money but they also have knowledge about the market that not every trader is privy to a market participant like cargill will have better knowledge of malaysian palm oil production in the near term than the average market participant simply because of their palm oil holdings and daily dealing with other suppliers institutions not only make the market they are the market if you are picking a side of the market to follow in the market place the odds are tremendously better when you stay on the side of the institutions but how do you know what the institutions are doing imagine they are a herd of elephants walking in the jungle they are knocking over trees stepping on bushes and leaving their footprints everywhere it is easy to see what they are doing trading volume tells us what these trading elephants are doing in the market by reading the volume in the order page of flow not only can we tell when an institution is active in the market but it also tells us whether the surrounding buyers or sellers are becoming stronger or weaker the companies that produce commodities and turn them into products don’t get big by being wrong on the markets at least not very often because of their size and their requirements for huge amounts of physical commodities these players are constantly in and out of the markets institutional traders are not concerned with wellknown indicators like macd rsi and stochastics they are concerned with the current and future state of supply and demand and use this analysis to make their trading decisions they listen to what the market is telling them and react accordingly but the hard part is determining when an institution is participating in the market in the old days when institutions had to place their trades through brokers if you had a good relationship with your broker they would tell you who was buying and selling for example if you called down to the floor and your broker said “deutsche bank is buying” or “goldman’s is selling” then if you knew paul tudor jones traded through goldman’s in the pit you were led to believe paul tudor jones himself was selling that was how order flow was back in the day of pit trading many institutions now execute their trades themselves electronically through broker provided trading front ends so it is not as easy as it once was one way to tell what an institution is doing is by reading the order flow you will see huge size go through particular levels it is important to watch the edges of the market the day’s high and low was there a big buyer or seller where were the levels of aggression a lot is written these days about the evils of algorithmic trading most people have no idea what algo trading is and they lump in with high frequency trading algo trading in one sense as applied for futures markets is a way to execute orders with minimal market impact it could be something as simple as an iceberg order or more complex like a ghost bid where the order is only shown when the market is offered at a level where the customer wants to buy it page of the reason these “algos” were created was for institutional players to hide their activities in the electronic market if everyone knows that an institution has lots of corn to buy at then other participants will also start to buy corn but not at the same price maybe just a little bit higher at and before the market starts to move higher and the institution can’t get filled at their level of so banks and hedge funds started to create algos to mask their market activities i won’t get into all the different types of algo trades that are available because that would be another book what is important to know is that whatever volume that is traded in the market either on the bid or offer will show up in the order flow size does matter in the markets and institutions do not want to tip their hand to everyone else you have to realize that most markets just do not have the available size an institutional size player wants to trade an institution may want to trade lots but there may only be lots available at a price lots at the next price lots at the next price lots at the next etc so to get their order completed they would either have to push the market to an unrealistic level or try and finesse their order into the market sometimes institutions have orders so large that they it can take hours or even days to move or build their position efficiently without bullying the market there are players that have positions of es futures bunds etc although they don’t get in or out all at once when they add or reduce positions it can be in the lot size one of the things i learned as a broker about the biggest and juiciest orders from institutions is that they do not always get filled an institution has a level or price range they want to participate at and stick with it they don’t call back and ask their broker to chase the market they want to get in at the price levels they want they don’t want to move the market and know that even if they miss the trade by a tick its ok there will be other opportunities in the future institutional traders don’t panic the same way retail traders do when the market starts moving and they are not getting filled on their orders page of here is an example on solid institutional buying in the corn market in the example above all you know is that someone is trying to buy a truck load of corn and that caused a short term rally of about cents over the next few days now the rub is you don’t know exactly if the institution is buying to get into a position or get out of one they could be hedging their position no one really knows except the actual people doing the buying ultimately you just don’t know the page of reason why they are active in the market a majority of the volume you see daily is pure speculation either long term or short term however there is a portion of volume that is end users buying for delivery if you constantly trade against institutions you will have a hard time being profitable in the long run futures’ trading has attracted some of the sharpest minds on the planet at the very least all you have to do is trade in the same direction as them if you are going to be trading alongside the institutions you need a way to determine the level of institutional activity in the market place or the lack of it order flow provides you that opportunity i am not saying you have to copy what the institutions are doing to be successful what i am saying is if you buy when the institutions are buying and sell when the institutions are selling you stand a far higher chance of success than trying to go against them constantly at the very least you need to be aware of what the big players are doing page of vwap vwap stands for volume weighted average price and is perhaps the most commonly used algorithm for trading today it assumes the markets are efficient the reason it is important is because it is the benchmark by which trade execution is measured it is the average price at which the majority of a given period’s trading took place weighted by volume at each price level in other words it means to fill a trade where everyone else is trading a broker can add value by working an order with their discretion buying when they thought the market was cheap or selling when the price looked rich based on their subjective judgement about the market vwap is a replacement for that when an institution has large orders that must be filled they will often use a vwap based algorithm to execute the order as close to vwap as possible by executing their order as close to vwap as possible it indicates that they have been able to minimize the market impact of their order hedge funds are conscious of their market impact costs which are the costs incurred by trades so big that they will move the market in a simple form vwap is used to determine value for institutional traders much in the same way a moving average works as a trading indicator but vwap is used more for trade analysis than trade entry when a buy order is filled at a price better than vwap it is good for the trader as the average transaction value is better than what everyone else in market for that time period also received the reverse is also true for when one is selling if a sell order is filled at a price better than vwap the trader is selling at a higher average price than everyone else during that time period vwap is the measuring stick for large orders when price is below vwap institutions that are looking to buy will tend to buy at prices below vwap as they are able to build a position that is better than the vwap they won’t be that willing to buy when the price is trading above vwap as it will ruin their own average price against vwap when price is above vwap institutions that are looking to sell or get short will try to execute their orders as they are selling at prices that they feel are better than what has been recently trading if an institution is page of trying to fill an order they won’t be as willing to buy when price is trading above vwap they may buy some just to participate in case price never comes back to vwap but it will be minimal the interesting thing about vwap orders is that there is no guarantee that it will be filled or that it will match vwap so why is vwap important for an intraday trader vwap is important because they can determine if they are selling too cheap or buying to rich when prices start moving or standard deviations above vwap and you are buying you could be buying at prices too expensive conversely if you are selling and prices are standard deviations below vwap you could very well be selling too cheap this is not to say that prices cannot move and even standard deviations away from vwap because it can when trading with order flow you can lay vwap lines on your chart to give you an indication if it trading cheap or rich i am more prone to take buy signals when the market is trading cheap and sell signals when the market is trading rich to vwap do not think for a minute that vwap has to revert to the mean a market can stay above or below vwap most of the day vwap is not without its limitations as the trading day goes on the lag in vwap become stronger this is because a lot of trade data has already been factored in and new trade data has less of an impact on the overall vwap number and will tend to flatten out on strong trending days price will be above or below vwap pretty much all day on range trading days vwap will run through the middle of price action on days when important news comes into the market late in the day that cause significant price movements on heavy volume the vwap profile will be affected how an order is executed will also affect the vwap since the average execution sits somewhere between the bid and offer spread to match vwap an order would need to be a combination of limit orders and market orders a problem i see with vwap with the trading public is they don’t fully understand how or why it is used the trading public is using it as a form of moving average and think that when the market breaks through page of vwap to look for it to go to the standard deviation and revert back to the mean in theory that should happen but the reality is it doesn’t happen i spent years at jp morgan executing vwap trades for the biggest hedge funds in the world and some of the biggest internal bank traders orders are only executed over a part of the day for example from cash open to cash close or the first hour of cash open etc very very few orders are executed vwap from the exact open to the exact close which is what most software will calculate and draw on a chart an order executed over the first hour beginning at the cash open would only look at vwap for that time period not the entire day vwap large orders need to trade where the size in the market a majority of trade happens at the open and the close don’t be misled into thinking that vwap is a new excellent indicator to take trades against as i mentioned earlier vwap is a way to measure a broker’s trade execution traders make money by buying low and selling high not by beating vwap page of iceberg orders one of the tricks that traders use to disguise their intentions in the market is by placing their orders using the iceberg function simply put iceberg orders are just large orders that are hiding their true size a trader may have lots of corn to buy but will enter his order with an iceberg of lots meaning he will only show lots at a clip when the first lots are filled then another order for lots will be entered automatically iceberg orders have mixed meanings these days simply because everyone uses them even retail traders trying the trade lots they will iceberg the order to show lot iceberg orders are used in nearly all markets nowadays even thinly traded ones in some markets depending on the time of day a lot order can spook the market a few ticks unfortunately to see iceberg orders one has to be watching the order book and what is trading in order to see them there is no special designation in the ticker for them icebergs are obvious when you are watching the bidask and you are buying the offer but every time you buy the offer it refreshes the quantity and doesn’t break through the level in my past life as an institutional futures broker we would almost always use icebergs on orders that were over lots it was normal for us to iceberg orders that we needed to get done immediately if i had to buy lots of soybeans i would use an iceberg of maybe lots per clip and immediately lift the offer if i know the size of my order will move the market i may even buy it or ticks beyond the offer to get a good portion of the trade on so it is not uncommon to see iceberg orders appearing in the middle of nowhere and sometimes you may not even notice it what is tricky about icebergs is that they can be significant or totally irrelevant you have to take them in the market context an iceberg order in the middle of a range can mean nothing it can be part of a spread trade against a physical trade and the trade doesn’t want to spook the market by showing his entire size in this case the trader doesn’t really have a view of direction on the market as he is hedging page of icebergs that i have found to be significant are ones that are holding up or holding down a market usually long term macro levels and psychological levels these are levels where the market can’t seem to get below or above the volume keeps refreshing when it trades a certain quantity when these icebergs are taken out the market can explode really quick in that direction an iceberg on its own will not stop a screaming market but it can serve as a sign of absorption where price is being absorbed by the market participants along this thread an iceberg can stop a pullback in the market as there may be some significant size behind it and a pullback has weaker selling but it most likely will not stop a trend because with a trend there is a tendency for aggressive participants to come in and take out levels a buy iceberg on a market moving up near highs is important as it can signal that a long term timeframe trader is getting involved in the market and doesn’t want to show his hand as he is building a position the reverse is true as a market nears its lows or is making new lows these other time frame traders may be coming into the market to move size and are afraid of moving price too much before they can get their entire size off but i think taking a trade based on an iceberg order appearing in the order book is a leap of faith the problem with iceberg orders is you have to be watching the market trade to notice them there is no way to look at a chart after the market closed and see it i think finding iceberg orders to use as a trade entry is over rated as they appear too frequently to add any value in making a trading decision in the end the traded volume from iceberg orders that are filled or even partially filled will show up in the order flow chart it is understandable that institutional traders want to hide their market activities and really the only way to see what the institutional traders are doing is by looking at an order flow chart page of support and resistance every trader should have levels they look for in a market that determine support and resistance how price acts at points that a trader considers critical is important to your trading you want to determine if other time frame traders are coming into the market at these levels to either defend a price level or push the market through the price level to a new level there are many ways to find support and resistance levels you can use traditional technical analysis such as pivot points fibonacci retracements moving averages previous highs and lows etc the question you want to ask is once you have your levels how do you know whether these levels are going to hold or break you let the volume tell you what the market wants to do here is an example using fibonacci retracements on minute corn charts corn is a great market to trade a lot of traders turn their noses up at the agricultural markets in favour of faster moving currencies and stock indices but there are no truer markets to supply and demand as the agricultural markets page of page of order flow charts give the trader plenty of information to make informed trading decisions especially when combined with their own view of the market if we are coming into a resistance level and we see buy volume slowing down or coming into a support level and see sell volume slowing down this is a good indication the market may reverse that is why you need to know where support and resistance are located otherwise you may just be poking around in the dark trying to understand if the market is at a turning point you need effort to break through a support or resistance level and continue in that direction this effort is usually shown by aggressive participants in the market place look for macro levels in the market to trade around a macro level is one that is large in scope and is easily seen and watched by market participants when a macro level is penetrated it attracts long term money in the form of institutions as they come in to the market to reposition themselves and take profits or loses is volume heavy at these levels is this level being defended or abandoned are buyers or sellers being aggressive looking at an order flow chart will tell you what is going on and tell you what to do page of previous highs and lows an often overlooked support and resistance level is the previous day’s high low and close these are levels that market perceived as being too expensive yesterday’s high or too cheap yesterday’s low baring a change in fundamentals what makes a trader think those prices won’t hold again today one of my favourite trades is when a market struggles to stay below yesterday’s lows and i see big volume numbers trading on the bid side i look for signs for a bounce higher there is a wellestablished tendency among retail traders to place their stop levels above the previous high or below the previous low this is a sign that there is support at these low prices because when short term traders try to move the price lower a bigger stronger other time frame participants are willing to buy their selling page of if the market starts to trade above and more importantly stay above the previous day’s high with heavy volume that signals that new buyers are coming in what the market is telling you is that yesterday the market couldn’t go any higher but since the market close something in the market fundamentals may have changed enticing new buyers to come into the market and get involved if the market can’t stay above yesterday’s high and sellers come in then watch out below look for a move to the downside page of page of the previous day’s close is an important level for the current day trading since the previous day’s close is the price level that positions are marked to market against it is the level that institutions use to determine if their position is making money or losing money when today’s prices start to trade to the previous day’s closing price keep an eye on volume for signs of further moves i am looking for levels to trade around an important high and low to watch is the previous month’s levels as they show where price was contained over an extended period of time when the market takes out one of these levels you know that change is occurring in the market place i find there are three things that can happen when you trade at last month’s high or low the market will fail to take out the level and trade back into the range the market will take out the high or low and then reenter the month range and bounce off the level as it is rejected once again trade outside of the month range and stay outside of the month range and new participants come into the market the and market actions are where the big opportunities are as the market previous month’s highs or lows short term traders who are not aware of long term levels have a high chance of getting run over by institutional trade participating at these page of levels additionally they may miss the potentially large intraday trading opportunities these levels often present so let’s take a look at what happens with a test of a monthly high and low in this example i will use the september corn futures page of page of what i like about this chart is that as the market traded below the low you see lots were sold into the bid at lots sold into the bid at and only sold into the bid at but as the market started trading back up only lots were bought at and lots bought at this signals to me that there isn’t much interest in sellers trying to work offers below in the bar there is lots bought at the offer at and bought at the offer at obviously someone had some selling to do but the market participants just swallowed it up and kept the market bidding higher now let’s look at what happened when the previous month’s high of was tested page of this is a beautiful chart the market traded right up to exactly the high of came off tried again in the next bar and couldn’t quite make it back to the level it was a tick off at but a big seller appeared to cap the buying and the market sold off for the time being the next day the market made a run at the high again and here is what happened page of this is exactly what you want to see with order flow strong buying coming into a previous high preferably aggressive buyers leaving buying imbalances and just moving through the level like it wasn’t even an important level the market never looked back while the market may not approach long term levels like previous month’s or even yearly highs and lows very often when it does the levels are extremely important institutions will often reduce their risk by taking off positions when the market reaches long term levels if prices become accepted outside the price levels contained by the long term levels these same institutions may decide to reestablish their position or enter into new positions page of today’s high and lows the high and low of the day is generally not going to be known until after it has been made however there are often signs in the volume footprint if a high or low is going to hold by judging the type of buying and selling occurred at a high or low you can determine if that level will in fact be the high or low sometimes it is easy to see other times you won’t know for sure stick with the ones that are easy to see as they offer the best reward for least risk trying to pick the day’s high or low can be like trying to catch a falling knife however the nice thing about order flow is it can give you some trading opportunities once a high or low is made you will never sell the exact high or low with order flow but you can find trading opportunities just after the high or low has been made also if a high or low has been made when the market comes back to test the level it will either succeed or fail here is an example of when a high was made point a and subsequent failures at point b and c page of page of page of as a trader your job is to find trades that is how you get paid but more importantly you need to find trades that have solid reasoning behind them futures markets now trade almost around the clock from sunday night until friday afternoon a trading day which used to be hours can now be as long as hours you don’t see gaps occurring as much as you used to now if something happens in the evening or early morning the markets are open and can react accordingly highs and lows made outside the normal trading day hours ie overnight often can help set the range for the day around the clock trading is significant because it gives traders in other locations a better opportunity to trade highs and low that are made during the overnight session are significant levels to watch during the day unless the market is in a trending mode the highs andor lows made during the night sessions will be revisited at some point during the day session and it is important to watch how markets react to those levels all major brokers and institutional trading firms have fully staffed desks that trade around the clock in all time zones they are constantly page of reacting to fundamentals affecting the market trading accordingly and adjusting their positions keep an eye on the levels made overnight what i love about order flow charts is that you can determine where and when buyers and sellers are being aggressive when the market is making new highs i like to see aggressive buyers this shows me that the buyers are clearly in control if i don’t see aggressive buyers and instead see aggressive sellers near the high i will look for the market to sell off you always want to know who is in control of a high or low how about when a market comes back to the high or low you want to determine if the level will be taken out and a new high or low made if a high is to hold i like to see some aggressive selling come in and defend the level just as i would expect with a low i would expect to see aggressive buying come in if a low is going to be taken out i expect to see aggressive selling come in at the level and below it page of when a market struggles to take out a high chances are lower that it will make a new high later in the session conversely if a market struggles to take out a low then the chances are lower that it will make a new low later in the session again volume footprint charts tell you when a market is struggling to take out a high or low a good sign to look for to decide if a high or low is going to hold is if there are stacked volume imbalances of sellers at a high or buyers at a low a stacked imbalance is where there are a multiple levels of volume imbalances a stacked imbalance shows who has taken control of the price area if you are at a low and see stacked buying imbalances that is a sign that aggressive buyers have come into the market to sweep it off its lows if you see selling imbalances near a high that is a sign that aggressive sellers have come in to move the market lower while you won’t see activity like this at every high or low when it does appear you can trade with more confidence markets rally off of lows for two reasons traders are covering shorts traders are getting long page of markets fall off highs for two reasons traders are taking profits in other words covering their longs but it is not phrased in that way traders are getting short picking when a high of day or low of day occurs and the subsequent reversal can be extremely rewarding but can be dangerous if you are wrong and don’t manage the trade properly order flow charts give you the ability to look inside the bar as it is forming on the chart there are certain patterns i like to look for at and near highs and lows they are large prints and small prints when you see huge volume as you reach highs it is a good sign the market may turn if there is no follow through or there is signs of absorption if a market cannot break through huge passive sellers and turns lower the weak buyers on the way up will be looking to get out of their positions before they suffer losses causing a liquidation break the result of this is that the weak hands are cleared out of the market on the liquidation break their supply has been transferred to the stronger hands and the market is now ready to rally again this is the meaning of the saying “a market needs to break before it can rally” i carry forward this previous level of huge volume that traded on the offers at a high to future trading sessions to watch and perhaps when we reach that level again it is important to note that the huge volume doesn’t have to occur exactly at one price point it can be scaled in there as it is not uncommon for passive sellers to work scale orders page of large prints that you see at a high signify that there is a large seller it could be one institution or it could be a combination of several market participants deciding that the high is such a great level to sell that they sell as much as they can to all the willing buyers they want to get rid of excess inventory at advantageous prices this is obvious is in an order flow footprint chart because it sticks out like a sore thumb when you see an abnormally large volume print at the high the market is telling you that institutions are selling to such an extent that higher prices are not possible the market has basically been “capped” institutions will not cap the market if they expect higher prices they will do it if they expect lower prices when you see abnormally large prints at a high it shows that institutional selling has come in to the market and is willing to offer their supply for sale this will usually stop an up move at least in the short term when the market comes back to test the highs and cannot break that high it is a sign of market weakness page of page of when you see abnormally large prints at a low it shows that institutional buying has come in to the market and is willing to accept all the supply available this will usually stop a down move at least in the short term when the market comes back to test the lows and cannot break that low it is a sign of market strength the opposite is true for large prints at a high small prints at a high or low are just as significant especially if it comes after a large print it shows that the last buyer at a high has given up or that the last seller at a low has given up markets that are rallying stop and go down when the last buyer has bought and there are no more buyers markets that are going down stop and reverse when the last seller has sold granted single prints are extreme but i like trades that stick out like a sore thumb you can actually use single digit prints like or or this is how the trade played out over the next few days… page of single prints suggest weakness the market simply cannot follow through in that direction and turns it could be caused by someone trying to trigger stops it could be the absolute last buyer came in and bought when you see extremely large prints or single prints at a top or bottom look for a turn in the opposite direction the risk for these trades is small as it is just behind the print that stuck out knowing when a market is ready for a reversal offers low risk entry points with possible high returns trying to identify them with a traditional bar chart can be difficult but if you follow the order flow you can notice it developing and trade it accordingly time spent at a high or low is also important for example when the market spends a long time near the lows without any downside follow through the market came down to the low and sort of hung around and trade was slowing down and the market just could not push any lower the intraday short start to become anxious they had helped to push the market down to the lows but they weren’t getting paid for it prices then start to tick higher the short term traders start to cover pushing the market higher causing more traders to cover their short positions ultimately there is a short covering rally and the low is made page of macro approach the macro approach is how i approach the market on a daily basis i want to get a big picture market perspective so i start with a longer term monthly and weekly charts do i see upward continuation downward continuation then i will look at daily and intraday charts and ask myself is the market in balance what are the value areas what are levels where there were big passive buyers or sellers each day before the market opens i identify these levels since these are the levels i will be trading around traders often get so focused on the shortterm market trends economic reports bloomberg news cnbc tv etc that they do not keep a perspective on what the market is actually telling them more often than not traders remain too narrowly focused on price and shortterm bars never fully appreciating the market’s ongoing auction process that takes place daily by taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture you will get a clearer market perspective and it will save you from becoming hypnotized by intraday price action staring at a dom or a chart all day can be dizzying with a macro approach i can see where the important long term levels are in the market so i can react accordingly page of trading numbers knowing where price can trade to and react off of is essential to success in trading you cannot just approach the market with a gut feeling for the day and trade according to it building on the macro approach each day we must prepare for the trading day by making a note of important levels where the market may have reactions  yearly high  yearly low  high months ago  low months ago  last month’s high  last month’s low  high days ago  low days ago  close days ago  yesterday’s high  yesterday’s low  yesterday’s close  overnight high  overnight low  resistance  support  pivot point  yesterday’s value area high  yesterday’s value area low  economic releases due today and time  any economic events today and time it may seem like a lot of numbers to keep track of but the reality of it is that it should only take a few minutes to make note of these levels on your chart page of other forces one of the basic premises in trading is that markets will do what they are supposed to do if they do not do what they are supposed to do then there is a reason that reason is that there are unusually strong forces at work temporarily acting contrary to what the markets want to do the trader can take advantage of this knowledge and go with the temporary strong forces and make a profit it may not be known why the other forces in the market until much later but being able to recognize them allows a trader the chance at short term profits when you see a big amount of volume trading at a top and the market can’t go bid there that is a sign of weakness you should look to get short there because there is another force at work there are ample traders buying but the market just cannot go any higher as it should this is a clear sign of other forces at work you will never know the intentions of a trader yet to enter the market at any given moment there could be an institutional player ready to step into the market and move it opposite of what you predicted an outside factor in the market that causes havoc with order flow is when there is an economic report coming out or an fomc meeting order flow will dry up ahead of the announcement and explode just after the announcement when i started out in the futures business as a clerk on the cme floor one of the things i learned was that when a number like nonfarm payrolls comes out the institutional players are not the ones doing all the trading that causes the knee jerk spike up and down reaction to price that you see on the chart they are already positioned on how they view the market it is usually the weak holders scrambling to cover their position and stops getting hit when the market slows down and has stabilized is the time when the institutional players will decide what to do sometimes the actual market direction might not emerge until the day after a big announcement or number i am an advocate of staying out of the market slightly before and just after any important number or announcement when trading in the short term of course there will be times the market just gets blindsided with some news you just have to be prepared to take the loss page of long term applications of order flow most traders who use order flow tend to apply it to short term trading decisions however it can also be applied to longer term outlooks position traders attempt to come up with models to forecast price movements of markets by analysing supply and demand forces in the economy economic indicators and even government policy one of the problems with forecasting models is that past variables are used to extrapolate future values a market forecast is only as strong as the data used to make it unfortunately fundamental data is usually based on samples and are estimates at best these estimates are usually subject to revision the same theories of order flow that appear intraday can be applied on long term charts here is a nice example of the euro currency futures it hit a high at on june then sold off about ticks over the next few days and down below over the next month could you have predicted it by looking at traditional candlestick or bar charts maybe you could have it is always easy to look at a chart after the fact and say that you would have sold here and bought there you wouldn’t have sold the exact high but realistically you could have sold around the level what you need are concrete signs of a turning point page of and here it is at the high of you have a buying imbalance of by itself is a big number but for extra confirmation you also have a buying imbalance at the top when the bar closed lower than it opened on the two preceding bars on the way up you can see some buying imbalances and the market still went up when it hit the market hit a brick wall there was a big seller or sellers it doesn’t really matter if it was one or more the buyers just could not push the market any higher past that level then you see a stacked selling imbalance on the way down the short term traders who bought at are now stuck and got to get out and they can’t sell fast enough page of this top just sticks out like a sore thumb as a reversal here is the daily chart again based on a daily candlestick would you have sold there are a couple of ways to look at it you can say that is a nice round number so there should be some resistance there but if that is the case why did it blow through even on the way up and down the previous month’s high was so we are still ticks off from it with order flow and looking inside the bar you can see what is actually going on between the buyers and sellers to make informed trade decisions order flow can identify reversals that may not be obvious to the rest of the trading world and that is reason enough to use them the advantage of order flow analysis is that the underlying forces of the market are shown in a recognizable visual form the market participants are showing you what their intentions are page of trade management and money management trade management is an overlooked part of trading nearly every book written on trading covers money management while defining your monetary risk per trade is important a trader should be able to manage their trades to earn the maximum they can out of a position while knowing when a trade is not working out professional traders recognize the fact that even when they do everything right they will sometimes find themselves on the wrong side during a trade market conditions are always changing and they accept that it is part of trading even the best looking trade set ups will sometimes fail create a set of rules that give you an edge if the rules are not met then no trade period once you start to bend the rules you start getting into trouble and getting into to trouble leads to one thing loses pick your spots to get into and out of trades ideally what you want are “sweet spots” of entry so that if the market starts to move against you it doesn’t feel like it by taking a reasonable profit if there are signs in a change of trend or change of reason for taking the trade you may avoid a loss you do give up profit potential though but more importantly you have the chance to trade again when trading with order flow you can usually see levels where the markets reach a level and can’t move anymore or you can see that the market is full of aggressive players and there is no need to get out of the position yet all successful traders practice sound trade and money management traders minimize their losses and maximize their wins there is no worse feeling than having been up substantially in a trade only to exit the trade at a loss simply because you lost your discipline with your trading plan money management and failed to heed your exit strategy there are only five possible outcomes to any trade you can have a big winner a small winner a breakeven trade a small loser or a large loser you can make a lot of money trading if you do any of the above except taking repeated large losses this is why stop have to be used in some form but you need to monitor the trade so you are not always page of getting stopped out for the maximum loss scaling out of positions gives you a way to get out with a small profit rather than a total loss i like to get in capture what part of the trend i can get my money and get out there comes a point in every trader’s life that he will realize that he will not pick up every tick in a trend let me give you an example let’s say you decide to go long corn at you know that at that your set up would be invalid so that is your stop level you have a target at at first the trade goes well and corn rallies up to then the market starts to range trade and you notice some absorption appearing around the level then the market start to drop to on some aggressive sellers the market conditions have changed and there are two clear signs of market weakness you didn’t reach your profit target and the conditions are now such that it looks unlikely that you will you can either start cutting your position and taking some profits or you can just try and let it run in a “damn the torpedos” type of trade either go to the target level or go to the stop level the former would be the prudent thing to do since the market has already shown you that it has changed loses are a part of trading that is a fact one way of looking at it is it is part of doing business that is why you have to control your losses keep them small and manageable don’t let one loss be the cause of your entire trading career failure a loss should not be a bullet to the head it should be more of a punch to the body one that you can take and keep trading keep loses small so you don’t get knocked out of the trading game it is imperative that a trader understand how to manage their risk with proper risk management a trader can have more losing trades than winning trades as long as the winning trades are bigger than the losing trades they will still make a lot of money being a good trader is about making money day after day never losing a lot losing only a little and not losing often a trader wants to make money often and make a lot when he does how does a trader do this they look for quality trades it is not just about looking for something to trade for the sake of trading it is about spotting quality trades and taking them it is not always about getting the big homerun trade every time it page of is about consistency if you are not consistent your capital will slowly erode and when the big homerun trade comes you won’t be able to capitalize on it the size of a move is nearly impossible to predict until it happens don’t spend all your time trying to hit home run trades look for low risk high probability trades that give you an edge and aim for profits of all sizes the setups i have laid out for you in this book will sometimes result in a big move sometimes a small profit or a small loss an often overlooked part of tradingmoney management is a trader’s own pain threshold this is the level where a loss starts to have an emotional impact on a trader knowing your pain threshold will reduce the emotionality in your trading decisions if your monetary threshold is ticks but your stop level is ticks away you will find yourself wanting to get out of trades too early because you are afraid of losing more this will have an adverse effect on your winning trades the worst enemy you can have marketwise is the desire to make the market do what you want it to do your wishes don’t count the market has a job to do and does that job in its own way if you feel that you are wrong just get out of the trade you have to determine the price you want to pay the level you want to get in if you miss a trade don’t chase it you will lower your profit potential and the reason for getting into a trade may have passed or the market conditions changed the markets provide trading opportunities everyday several times a day missing a trade is not the end of the world there will be many more trades in the future a mistake traders make is getting into a trade and waiting for the market to react and then it doesn’t do anything it just range trades in and out of profit for a while when you have a setup based on certain criteria and the market doesn’t react the way it is supposed to that is a clear sign to get out or reduce the size of the position to minimize the risk if a lot of time has elapsed and the position is not in the money the chances of it going into the money are getting reduced with each second of the clock traders sit and wait for a breakout when there is no breakout occurring if the breakout is not there get out and prepare for the next trade opportunity don’t marry a trade that is going nowhere hoping that it will page of finally turn and go your way you will miss the other trades that are setting up after a while if a trade is not developing as planned you have to start thinking of bailing out of the trade as the reason for getting into the trade may have changed an over looked form of stop is a time stop most people think of stops in terms of price if the market moves against them a certain amount they get out a time stop is based on time when a trader gets into a position but the market just range trades and goes nowhere over a long period of time the reasons for taking the trade in the first place have diminished because the market is not moving it would be wise to get out and reassess the market as opposed to having a position on and being married to it a trader can think more clearly without a position on than with a position on going nowhere or even slightly against him there is a luck factor involved in trading anything can happen on any given day there are going to be times when you join the sellers and you are the last seller and you sell the exact low and the market turns and rallies against you there are going to be times when everything looks perfect you get in and the market moves but only a or points and your target is points you miss your target by one point before it moves against you never to return there is nothing you can do about it because you cannot will the market to move the extra tic there will be days when you can do nothing wrong you get short the market and it just falls out of bed and you make a ton of money luck goes both ways retail traders think that they can hide behind support and resistance levels that if they place their stops behind support and resistance levels their losses will be minimal but the reality is that many professional traders know where these levels are go look for them to trade around because that is where the volume will be the most important question when deciding to enter a trade is “what risk am i getting into with this trade” most new traders read a few books on trading and the books all tell you that you can manage your risks by using stops but what they don’t tell you in the books is that stops will help you get out of a position but there is no guarantee you get out at your desired level the market can blow right through your level and you page of can be filled at a price much worse than your desired exit level using stops is not risk management there is a lot of nonsense in the market when it comes to stops while i agree that stops should always be used as traders are wiped out not by taking relatively small repeated loses rather traders are wiped out by taking an occasional big loss a good stop loss point should be part of your trading plan and decided upon before any trade is entered you need to be willing to get out of a trade when the reason for being in the trade in the first place is no longer valid saying that you have to use a hard and firm point stop or something like that on every single trade is wrong yes you do need a point at which you have to get out of a trade no matter what but a trader will realize that when the conditions change that they need to get out the most important factor for choosing a stop loss level is actually very simple it should be the price level that would indicate that the setup has become invalid this should be common sense if you get into a position based on a bullish setup where would the price need to go to invalidate the setup getting stopped out of trades too often is a sign that your stops are too tight you may think having tight stops make you a prudent trader but you are actually increasing your risk and the chances of getting stopped out trades need a little room you should look to place your stop at a place where there is a structural reason not a hard and fast one size fits all type of stop you should not be getting stopped out too often if you are always getting stopped out it is a sign that you still have a lot to learn you should be getting out under your own power and decisions when i first started trading i swear that i thought i was psychic or something for getting out or setting my stop right at the exact level that the stop gets elected then the market dramatically turns around and goes directly to my profit level order flow footprint charts give me better stop locations remember that not all trades work although the probabilities are greatly in your favour that the trade will be successful there is also the small probability that the trade will fail if a trade does not work out that doesn’t mean that the analysis was incorrect there may have been a change in page of market sentiment from the time the trade was established with order flow analysis you will be able to detect the changes and exit the trade think like a boxer a boxer is not going to win a fight unless he can take a lot of hits when you see a boxer getting punched it doesn’t mean that he is going to lose the fight it is his ability to absorb the hits and come back and be aggressive and punch back at the right times that determines if he will win or lose a lot of selfproclaimed trading gurus tell you that once you are in a position and that it starts moving in your favour that you should move your stop to break even the problem with this is that when you are trading around a level especially a macro level there will be a lot of tug of war going on between buyers and sellers if you are convinced in your method of trading you have to give your trades a chance to get to your level one of the worst feelings as a trader is knowingly leaving money on the table by moving your stop to break even too soon there is a saying “you will never go broke taking profits” but the second line should be “you will never get rich getting out of trades early” taking small profits is the surest way to ultimate losses as small profits are never allowed to develop in full size or even enormous profits a trader does not need to worry so much about their stops getting elected when they have a better read on the directional bias or better entry level or market timing when a trader stops following the same old technical analysis that everyone else does and starts looking at market structure then they don’t have to worry about their stops so much your decision to get out of a position means that you think the market conditions have changed when you are in a position your thoughts will be biased to support your position you must remember the reason for getting into a trade in the first place and respect it if the reason for entering into a trade has disappeared and you are still in the trade then you are just looking to lose money once you have decided to get out of a trade don’t think you can pick a price level to get out at just get out and take a fresh look at the market every now and then you may be able to pick up a few extra ticks here and there trying to pick a level to get out at but more often than not the page of market will move away from you and then you will end up taking a full loss at your stop level just because you tried to save a few extra ticks exits are the most important half of the trading equation because where you get out of a trade determines your profits and losses so don’t take it lightly most traders are focused on the trade entry and not so much on the exit page of proper trade execution proper trade execution is the ability to act on an opportunity the moment you identify it while it is easy to look at a chart after the fact and say that you would have sold here or bought there the fact is that it is easier said than done there are no guaranteed outcomes when it comes to trading every time you enter into a position you put your money at risk but traders want guaranteed outcomes and that is why they hesitate to put on a position or get out of a position when you enter a trade or are in a trade it is because of a conscious decision you made about the state of supply and demand unlike gambling where the result is random and not based on your analysis when you lose a bet at a casino you accept it because it is random when you are in a trade and it is losing money you start to second guess yourself and take on additional stress proper trade execution is the ability to remove the second guessing and act accordingly when you see a trade to get in and manage a trade once you are in it and exit the trade when it is time to exit page of pyschological aspects of trading there is more than money involved in trading your trading can have an effect on your life without you even knowing it trading affects your mood trading affects your appetite trading affects your relationships when you are making money the world is perfect and you have it in the palm of your hand but when you lose money your stomach can tighten your temper can shorten or worse as a trader you want to make money every day setting an easy attainable goal will help a trader’s confidence people start trading because they want to make money too often when new traders start out they want to make big money right away they want to make a million dollars this year starting with an account of that is not really an attainable goal it is just not realistic start with a daily goal of or once you are able to reach your daily goal you can always increase it and build on it from there for example if the goal is ticks once ticks is reached you can pause and determine if you still want to continue trading for the day on good trading days you can make or ticks but if it was a struggle to make the ticks you may want to stop and take a breather if you are down ticks it is a sign that things are not going right you need to reduce your size pay closer attention to what the market is telling you if you just can’t get into positive territory it may be time to stop trading for the day by having an easy attainable daily goal you can start to string together winning streaks psychologically speaking once you are able to put together winning streak it will help you mentally when you think back on them “i made money days in a row i made money days in a row” it gives you the confidence when you have a losing day it is like what recovering alcoholics go through in rehab they try and get through the next hour without a drink then the next day then days become weeks weeks become months winning days become weeks weeks become months months become years the market will still be here tomorrow so don’t feel that you have to wrestle it to the ground all in one day just like with sports the champion doesn’t win the league by pounding the other team in just one match it is a series of matches over a period of time by which the champion is decided page of consistency is the key to success as a trader for most traders sure there are some traders out there that will have out of trades that are losers but the trade covers all losers and makes a lot of money most traders would be so emotionally drained suffering through consecutive losses that by the time the trade came along they might not see it all the way through and close it out early with only a small win that takes discipline and understanding one’s own trading ability huge winning trades will come but the problem is you do not know when they will come you need to be prepared mentally as well as financially to take advantage of when they come instead it is important to understand your own trading personality every trader is different and it affects the profits and losses can you take big losses in return for big winners or are you willing to take a series of small losses and small winners are you comfortable trading on small time frames of to minutes or would you rather trade with a minute or even daily charts you need to find your comfort zone as a trader page of overtrading and greed overtrading has been the downfall of many traders over the years there are many reasons for overtrading the main one is greed being greedy is easy after a few profitable trades you start to think trading is easy and take borderline trades that don’t exactly fit your criteria but are close enough to meeting your trade requirements even though they don’t really qualify but you take them anyway because you think you can make more money another example would be when you increase your order size even though your recent trades have been losers but you want to try and make back your losses by booking smaller gains or thinking that by adding more contracts you can cover back your losses quicker a lot of traders will average down their losing trades with additional trades the “i am right and the market is wrong” trade you get angry at the market and take it personally never rationalize losing money with your need to make money it is easy to think you can get more money out of a trade when it is moving in your favour but that is feeling is wishful thinking it is not based on any factor wishful thinking in the market will not make you money on a consistent basis when you are up points in a trade and that is your price target don’t all of a sudden think you can squeeze out an extra point boredom is also a cause for overtrading some people have a need for action don’t trade for excitement the market is not your casino when you gamble and win it might be because you had a gut feeling or were just plain lucky if you start trading based on your gut feeling or relying on luck then you are not trading you are gambling basically you have taken your trading plan and thrown it out the window stick to your trading plan overtrading is one of the fastest ways to blow up an account page of sitting out is a trade i have spent most of this book talking about getting into and out of trades but there are a lot of times when you are not in a trade and that is a trade in itself knowing when not to trade is just as important as knowing when to trade i am sure you have heard the phrase “trade with the trend” well what do you suppose you do when there is no trend sit on the side lines and wait for the market to show you it is trending it takes discipline but if there is no reason to be in a trade then you should not be in a trade there are going to be days when you can do nothing right in the market these are the days when you can’t get into a winning trade to save your life when the market is acting unpredictably by that i mean your entry setups are failing one after another then you know the market is not acting as it normally does and you should sit out for a while it could be due to lack of liquidity and the market can move faster and farther on small volume it could be that a big position is being unwound and the player isn’t so concerned about price they just want out page of conflicting signs the market will do what it wants to do one thing traders cannot predict is what other traders will do i don’t mean finding a level where there may be some big stops are than can be run or where there may be size in the order book what i mean is a trader has no idea if or when an institutional player may change their thinking about supply and demand or when a participant needs to do an arb trade or hedge a physical sale when you starting thinking the market must do what you think it will do based on your analysis you will become doomed when the market starts to move against you for example say you got short because you read the market as being heavily sold based on your analysis the market drops a few ticks then the market shows aggressive buying coming in during the same bar your original read says the market will go down but it is not really dropping and you ignore the signals that are showing the market is poised for a rally because you are already in a position this is a conflicting signal if you weren’t in a trade and were looking at a chart the next day you would probably say to yourself that you would have passed on both trades since they were conflicting or you would think to yourself that it is obvious that you would have taken the trade that worked but since you find yourself in the trade you might miss or dismiss the change in the market and hope the market continues in the direction of your original trade it is ok to be wrong about the market but it is not ok to be wrong about the market direction and ignore the signs that it is time to get out of the position your read of the market can be wrong just as easily as it can be right you have to accept that you will be wrong being a successful trader is much more difficult than it appears experience is a long process of watching the markets and learning to recognize situations as they appear here is a chart of what i mean by conflicting signs you get into a position based on what the market is telling you but then you get a signal that the market conditions have changed it can either be the setup is invalidated or another trade setup in the opposite direction page of in this example we got long based on a series of small prints but just bars later before the market got to my take profit area a setup in the other direction appears you have choices you can either start getting out of your position wait for the market to either hit your profit target or you stop loss or flip your position this is where reading the market via the order flow is useful in the above example i chose to scale out rather than flip my position because the even through there was a sell set up i felt there was support in the market with the stacked buying imbalaces so i didn’t feel like the market was ready for a big sell off i thought it will trade lower and range trade for a while page of common characteristics of a trading opportunity trading opportunities arise when you can identify market developments as they are occurring any form of market analysis is only useful in as much as it is readable and reliable trading opportunities need to be easily recognizable and determine market direction order flow allows me to quickly see opportunities developing and keep an eye on them as they develop so as to be ready to trade them when they can be confirmed i have a basic set of criteria so to speak that i adhere to when looking over the markets before getting into a trade on either the buy side or the sell side if these basic criteria can’t be met then chances are the trade opportunity is not there what i look for in buys  a closed footprint with positive delta  a closed footprint where the candlestick was green up  evidence within the bar that buyers have aggressively bought the seller’s offers at subsequently higher prices  significantly higher volume traded on the offer than the bid what i look for in sells  a closed footprint with negative delta  a closed footprint where the candlestick was red down  evidence within the bar that sellers have aggressively sold into the buyer’s bid at subsequently lower prices  significantly higher volume traded on the bid than the offer the best buy signals are when a market starts to move up and showing buying imbalances while the market is breaking out of the accumulation stages as noted by signs of absorption the shift from adequate supply to stronger demand is happening in the market place and trends can start the best sell signals are when a market starts to move down out of an area of absorption and showing selling imbalances sellers are page of overwhelming the buyers with excess supply when a market starts to drop due to excess supply it can drop very fast not every trading opportunity is going to look exactly alike the volume numbers will vary the aggressive participant’s position in a bar will vary the location of the cot will vary what will remain the same is the concept behind the setup being a successful trader is much more difficult than it appears experience is a long process of watching the markets and learning to recognize situations as they appear page of putting it all together i have explained a lot in this book and shown many different examples what i am going to show you is how i put it all together to get make a trading decision there are many different styles of trading the futures markets and no one style is right or wrong what i am showing you is how i trade what i have to say may either make total sense to you and be similar to how you already trade or i may make no sense to you whatsoever and you will think i am a crackpot i am not saying my way is the best way for you to trade but it just happens to be what works best for me these trade setups have a very high probability of success they may not occur every day but they happen enough to put up some impressive profits i use these set up in all major futures markets es ym zn zc and many more a major problem that many traders have is too many indicators that their screen is so cluttered that it is difficult to make a decision because one indicator says buy and another one says sell i like to keep my screen clean so it is easy to see trade setups as they are happening traders often get caught up using complex technical indicators that are based on price to try and predict the market movements what they tend to forget is that the main driver of price direction comes down to simple supply and demand if we see demand for a product service commodity or currency accelerate we will begin to see increasing prices for that product economists call it “the law of demand” not the “theory of demand” or the “idea of demand” the law of demand and the law of supply like the law of gravity is a proven concept i will show you how supply and demand affects price and how to use order flow to predict market moves that would otherwise not be noticed with traditional charting methods the main focus of this book is to show you how i identify hidden trading opportunities that have low risk entries the techniques here are the simplest and most direct that can easily be seen with order flow footprint charts page of this set up can be traded on just about any futures market with decent volume and any intraday time frame or range or volume chart take a look at the bar chart below can you tell by looking at the candlesticks that the market was ready to turn around it is easy to look back at a chart well after the fact and say “oh yeah the market looked like it was ready to turn around” but why would you say that is there any evidence other than the bar closed lower than where it opened it couldn’t even close lower than the previous low page of now look at the orderflows chart do you see that big red number at the top that is a buying imbalance greater than traded on the offer at in the previous bar there were lots that traded at the same price and traded just below at these are traders who got into the move at the very end these could be traders who tried to push the market higher to continue its upward move it doesn’t really matter what the people were thinking that bought that high someone has to buy the high what is important is that we have an imbalance at a recent high it doesn’t need to be the high of the day it can be the high of a swing move you have all these people that bought at the high and the market couldn’t go any higher so how do we trade this you see a selling imbalance at the top on a high i like the imbalance to occur at the high of the bar rather than the second or third price from the high like in the previous bar page of the bar closed lower than the open so we see that there was some selling pressure to cause the market to drop if there are some selling imbalances in the bar even better but it is not necessarily needed wait for confirmation of the high by waiting for the bar to close there will be times when it looks like you have a set up and want to get in early but the bar hasn’t closed yet and the market reverses and the setup is erased and you are in a position you shouldn’t be in choose your entry there are many ways you can enter you can just enter at the market once the next bar has begun you can try and scale in the length of the setup bar but you run the risk of missing the trade when it just shoots straight up the way i trade it is i like to get involved no matter what so i will sell contracts at the market then i will scale the rest in between the low and high of the setup bar in case there is a retracement sometimes there are retracements and sometimes not i like to try to get in also during a retracement by working a limit order around the middle of the bar place your stop i like to place my stop ticks above the selling imbalance price in the setup bar just to give it some room this is more generous than i really should you can place your stop at the imbalance price or a tick below it since that would invalidate the set up once in while price does go back up to retest the high before going lower in this example i would have placed my stop at take profit level you can be either mechanical or discretionary in deciding where to get out in the es i will put in a take profit level points away once i get into a position i monitor it and see if the conditions change if they do i just get out for example i may get a setup in the opposite direction as you will see there will be some trades that seem so obvious they are “slam dunks” these are the trades with high probability low risk and high reward i like setups that generate signals with winners that are at least twice the size of losses and a minimum winning average however i have that winning averages are optimum and realistic page of once your entry setups have be defined don’t fiddle around with them trying to make them marginally better what you should do is focus your attention and work on making you exits better you can pick tops and bottoms and have a high success rate if you are quick to realize when you are wrong you won’t be getting in at the exact low but pretty darn close usually in the next bar not all trading opportunities occur near the highs and lows often times a move can happen when the market is range trading trends come out from periods of consolidation page of this is a trade that is you will only find with order flow analysis it won’t show up on a traditional bar chart you need to look inside of the actual bar to see what is trading to fully understand the market the battle between buyers and sellers is constantly going on when one side starts to take over that is the side you want to be on page of what i like about these trade setups is that they provide low risk entries to the market because you know exactly where you want to get out if the trade breaks down not adhering to a defined money management stop is the most common cause of failure among traders the great setups like these are not something that just happens once in a while but almost every day some days there might be only one or two trading opportunities some days there might be none as i mentioned in the beginning order flow footprint trading is not for everyone but i think it is a useful skill and tool for traders to learn and understand the downside of order flow trading is that it can be a labour intensive style of trading depending on your time frame you may end up spending a good deal of your time paying attention to the order flow as it occurs you should try to avoid the marginal trades and concentrate on the good setups page of each day in the market is different some days the market will have periods of choppy trading followed by slightly larger trends on other days the market will trade in one direction most of the day while some days will be more challenging than others you should still have profitable days using these setups so there you have it simple easy to understand setups a key point to keep in mind is that order flow trading is not an exact science you still need to trade in the direction of the market and be flexible at first sight the details of trading off of order flow and foot print charts may seem laborious over time as you get more comfortable with what to look for in the order flow you will find yourself making more high probability trades successful traders are patient and disciplined successful trading begins in your mind develop patience and disciple if you want to be successful you might ask me why does patience play such an important role in trading in order to answer that question you should look at and compare the different ways that institutional traders and retail traders do their trading generally speaking retail have shorter time frames to hold losing positions because they tend to be leveraged more than institutional traders and just don’t have the financial resources to take too much heat when a position goes against them remember the best traders always trade when they feel they have an edge to put the odds in their favour and they trade for one reason only and that is to make money they don’t trade simply because the market is open and they have a need for action they have discipline just wait for the right setup whenever it happens and take what the market gives you after all that is the nature of trading taking what the market gives you before you get too excited these setups while impressive are not the holy grail traders are always looking for the nice thing about order flow set ups is that they have their own built in stop loss ie your stop loss is basically the high or low of the set up bar page of how i use orderflows software to find trades the following are some examples of trades i have taken all of them incorporated orderflows techniques since i trade futures the examples are futures oriented also my basis is short term so the examples will be based off of intraday charts i believe each person has their own unique trading style how you trade is different than how i trade you probably don’t have the same thought process as i do the purpose of this chapter is not to give you a firm set of rules for taking trades it is to show you how to incorporate order flow into your trading hopefully by seeing the examples here you will have a better understanding of using order flow in your trading there are several types of setups that i am always on the lookout for a small print single print high or low that occurs at a low or a high i also look for a small print print that occurs just after a high or low for buys the print should occur on the bottom of a bar that closed higher for sells it should occur at the top of a bar that closed lower the single print should be between and the ratio for a small print and single print should be greater than at the minimum i am not interested in a single print of say lots when the next number is lots i want the small print to be because there was just no more buying or selling interest not because of low volume a market that is bottom heavy or top heavy this is a variation of a large print this occurs when the extreme bottom or top print is much greater than the next print for example and and the reason i like to look for these big prints on the lows or highs of the bar is it indicates to me that there are either a strong buyer or seller that came into the market with a big bid or offer this caused the other participants to scramble and try and jump ahead of the larger orders i have the ratio set to and below meaning the extreme print is greater than the next print page of trapped selling imbalances at highs or trapped buying imbalances at lows this marked with a green arrow when it is a trapped buying imbalance and a red arrow if it is a trapped selling imbalance if there is a confluence with another setup for example a small or single print or a top or bottom heavy print then that gives me a little more incentive to take the trade setup i prefer to see trapped buyers on or near the low and trapped sellers on or near the high orderflows divergence the orderflows divergence is a little different than the other divergence indicators out there it is marked on the screen with a green triangle for a bullish divergence setup and a red arrow for a bearish divergence setup what makes the orderflows divergence setup different is that we require an extra confirmation that the market has turned for a bullish divergence setup we require the market to make or equal a new low have positive delta and the bar to close higher relative to where it opened for a bearish divergence setup we require the market to make or equal a new high have negative delta and the bar to close lower relative to its open most order flow divergence signals only require a new or equal high and negative delta or a new or equal low and positive delta by qualifying the bar close relative to its open we have eliminated a lot of false signals which can occur when there is absorption a lot of two way trade going on at a high or low we need to see price move as well page of so let’s now take a look at the setups as they occur so that you can better understand how to apply them in your trading setups are like snowflakes no two are exactly the same although they may look similar this first chart i call being top heavy in cl one of the indicators of orderflows software is that it for a down candlestick it takes the top two numbers and divides them and for an up candlestick it takes the top two numbers and divides them then plots the ratio number below for a bar that closes lower and below for a bar that closes higher i have the software set so that when the ratio is below it will print the ratio in blue meaning for a down bar that the second number is much less than the top number in this case at point a when you divide into you get this is important because it indicates there was more volume traded on the offer at the high than the level just below it in theory it should be less as you get higher in price the buying should be less before prices decline the indication here is that there is a seller willing to step in at this level with supply page of at point b we also see a bar where the top number is greater than the number beneath it this bar is a doji in japanese candlestick terms and is a sign of market indecision the orderflows software does not mark ratios on doji candlesticks because i have found that the market could really go either way at point c there is yet another ratio this time it is which indicates to me that the bar has a top number much greater than the number just below it this indicates to me that there is ample supply in the market and that every time the market tries to go higher someone comes in and offers their supply for sale the market sold off from the level to the level i have the ratio set to or less ideally i like to see a number below which would indicate that the extreme number is a minimum twice as big as the next number however it is not set in stone i can’t say that it only works if it is or below i execute my discretion for ratios between and because i also take into account the volume that actually trades you could have a ratio of which would look good but the volumes involved might only be lot and lots which is hardly convincing this is why i don’t create a bot to trade this i like to see the ebb and flow of the market i am the trader not the computer page of the next chart highlights the single print high set up it occurs when there is a single print in volume volume of or less at a high or low the orderflows software draws a red box if there is a single print in a bar that closes down or a green box if the bar closes up also the ratio is printed above or below the bar if it is greater than ideally the bigger the number the more powerful it signal this single print is off the richter scale it measures in the interest rate futures you do tend to get big ratio numbers like that when i see big ratios like that i look to get short as soon as the bar closed this was on a minute chart the market could not even print more than the lot when it traded that level it could have been some algo buying the lot to see if there are any stops there earlier it traded there for lots but on the retest only one person was interested in paying that high this next chart is a variation on the single print high i call it the small print high it occurs when the ratio between the top and second to top number is greater than sometimes the market just pushes through a level but can’t go any higher because all the buyers are exhausted the page of only traders who will see this trade are those who are trading order flow the rest of the world won’t notice it they will just see a big down bar there is also something else in this chart that is quite powerful to trade with when you look at bar a you see two buying imbalances in the candlestick wick and selling imbalances in the body that tells me the sentiment has changed in the market as the bar was forming the bar opened up with some strong aggressive buying but the market just couldn’t carry through and strong aggressive selling came in so with the small print high and the imbalances this is a strong indication for the market to sell off page of in the next chart we have two setups occurring at the same time confluence there is a trapped selling imbalance and a ratio trade i like it when there are two setups in a bar it gives me more confidence in taking the trade although it is no guarantee that the trade will work ok so here we have a selling imbalance on a low of a bar where the bar closed higher and there are some buying imbalances in the body just barely but still near the opposite end of the bar also the ratio between the bottom number of and the second number of is just barely under the ratio of this is why i like to include between and so i can eyeball it and make my own decision to take the trade or not lots at the low in the crude oil is a decent number i really think that as a trader you have to know how to read the signals just because a set up occurs doesn’t mean you have to take it if the volume doesn’t look right then you can pass page of let’s now take a look at an orderflows divergence trade the problem with divergence that i had in the past was when the market was trending you could get a lot of divergences appearing on the way up when the market constantly is making new highs throughout the trading day or new lows after seeing the problem with a trending market and divergence i came to the conclusion that price also has to start moving away from the high or low for it to be a valid divergence the beauty of this setup is that the stop placement is just behind the high or the low as you can see you can catch some nice moves but remember that you can also get chopped up in a one way street type of trending market orderflows divergence is a powerful setup because it occurs at the day’s low or high if institutions are bullish on the market they will support the market which entails them to buy at or near the low if institutions are bearish they will need to sell at or near the high so the market doesn’t go higher page of wrap up no matter what kind of trader you are there are certain basics common to the markets which will ultimately determine whether you make money or lose money there are books videos websites training courses from many different sources which promise you the easy road to trading success i will tell you right now that there is no easy mechanical way to trade and win consistently the markets are always changing factors that move the markets are always changing it is not really that tough it just takes some time and patience and practice on your part to become a profitable trader a study of order flow reveals patterns that occur again and again the overall trend will be either up or down regardless of the number of changes in direction within the period once a trend has been determined ride along with it if there is a signal that the trend is starting to head the other way jump off and prepare yourself for the next turn trying to go against the trend is like trying to swim up river against the flow of water once you start to learn to read what the market is telling you it is then that you can see patterns emerge if there is a pattern most of the time there is no discernible pattern the market is facilitating trade just as it is supposed to nothing is certain in trading fundamentals and technicals can change at any time during a trade there are a multitude of uncertain factors that can make short term price swing occurs option hedging delta positioning portfolio adjustments risk onrisk off trades a fed official speaking etc all these things and more will affect your position with order flow analysis you can see what is developing in real time and react to it as it is happening there is a time to buy and a time to sell no set formula is infallible but knowing how to interpret order flow is invaluable in minimizing your losses and making your trades more profitable practice practice practice get screen time pour over charts and look for instances where the market turned and try and understand what market forces were present that caused the move great atheletes spend hours and hours a day practicing guys like david beckham or page of cristiano ronaldo take ’s of practice shots from all over the field so during game time when they are in that situation they know exactly how to take that shot they take the pressure of themselves since they know what to do once you finish reading this book you will likely feel confident that you can successfully trade using order flow in all likelihood you will because you will understand order flow better but that doesn’t mean you should jump right in and start throwing around size trades you do need some practice first being able to read the charts in real time and being able to make trading decisions on entering or exiting a trade requires practice until it become almost second nature or in other words reactionary the actual steps of entering a trade into a trading system may not seem all that important to your trading but it is easy to make a mistake by clicking on the wrong price or quantity or even mix up a buy order with a sell order get practice entering orders yourself it will serve you well in the future mistakes cost money if you enter into a trade in error just get out don’t try to finesse the error or scratch it it can easily go from bad to worse and very quickly just chalk it up to experience and don’t make the same mistake again really the only way to develop this intuition is by extensive practicing after you have watched your realtime charts long enough and have witnessed many different types of setups as they happen you will begin to understand what the market is doing based on the order flow this book will give you the knowledge about order flow trading but you need to develop the experience of using this knowledge through actual trades remember there are immutable laws in the market as demand goes up prices go up as supply increases prices go down congratulations on making it to the end of this book hopefully this isn’t “the end” for you but rather just the beginning of trading with order flow now is the time for you to start applying what you have learned watch the charts do some trades and practice simply reading this book won’t transform you into a successful trader even though many of you will be using this book as a reference guide when it comes to order flow trading at least i hope you will it doesn’t page of mean that everyone will use order flow in the same way as i do some of you may incorporate only parts of what i have shown you here every trader has different idiosyncrasies and our risk tolerances differ some people are going to read this book and flat out tell me i am just wrong in my analysis of order flow or that order flow charts are nice but not really that important i am fine with that i don’t need everyone to agree with my way of trading the markets after all that is what gives me an edge in the market happy trading mike page of pvsra pricevolumesr analysis posts on pvsra by sonicdeejay traderathome jrissaetc compiled by why do we use pvsra ……………………………………………………………………………………………… money management for using pvsra by jrissa …………………………………………………………… fire at will the enemy is being routed ……………………………………………………………………… introduction pvsra and money management by tah ……………………………………………… pvsra tutorial ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… the “sr” in pvsra …………………………………………………………………………………………………………… using pvsra to determine if the mms are bulls or bears……………………………………………… pvsra trading examples in real time pictures …………………………………………………………… pvsra is part of sonicr system there now are two kinds of trades in the sonic r system classic this is an ema dragon based method of trading that uses price action wave analysis sr and a bit of volume to validate a setup for a single entry trade scout this is a pure price volume and sr based method of trading that uses a unique analysis of price action volume and sr called pvsra to determine two things if the market is bull or bear and accordingly at what optimal price areas to make entries to build a trade of multiple positions much as the market itself is doing pvsra rules if mms are bears avoid sonic r long setups if mms are bulls avoid sonic r short setups or it is ok to be countertrend just never be counter mm pvsra is intended to analyze price bars when high volume shows are the bars lower or higher than before and has pa generally been drifting upwards or downwards etc analyze volume simply spot when volume is relatively higher analyze price and volume relative to sr once and exist where is it all happening relative to whole half and even quarter number natural sr levels why do we use price volume analysis a study of volume is not the basis for a sonic r system trade however if a current sonic r setup points in the same direction that a study of recent volume points to then there can be added confidence the setup will not end in a head fake also if you are in a sonic r system trade and suddenly a green or red bar appears especially if the volume bar is exceedingly tall that should alert you to the possibility the run is nearing the end the blue bars are simply an indication business is picking up the greenred bars denote institutional trading went into high gear these greenred bars can come near the beginning of a move so possibly denoting a run is in the making however if the resultant move was very modest ending soon after such bars then these bars can be denoting both the beginning and end something like the final spurt of activity and possibly before a reversal these greenred bars can also come during a move so possibly denoting a run is coming to a close or a pause conclusions drawn from the study of the relationship between price and volume cannot be exacting for one thing forex volume is only the count of trades on your brokers server not the marketwide count on total currency being traded for another thing and more importantly the big money trading outfits can turn price around on a dime and send it far off in the opposite direction and they can do this at any time no matter what any sort of technical study has been telling you at any time when an mm starts building a position or decides to add to one you will see the price move up and down or down and up this keeps the price in a range and makes the average cost more attractive than if the mm simply kept buying in an upwards direction or selling in a downwards direction sometimes there can be more than two swings and they do not all have to strike the same highs and lows the point is that by manipulating the price up and down the mm keeps from moving the price up too high while buying or from moving too low while selling consolidation areas on charts are where you see the price has constantly moved up and down within a range and in a concentrated fashion the market term consolidation is another of those benign and palatable words that really avoids telling the truth the truth is that when you see these areas on a chart you know there is a concentration of mms buying or selling if you could figure out which it was and sometimes you can then it makes you a less easy target for the mms to steal money from you cannot tell from the updown price gyrations put on by the mms when they are active buying or selling which it is other kinds of information must be added to the mix volume is unique information because it is not a technical that is a calculated derivative of price information as all other technical are it is the one technical that can show you something that no other technical can show you it can show you the price areas the mms are doing most of their trading at the higher prices or at the lower prices is it any wonder that in the forex market the volume information given to us is prostituted down to a count of trades rather than a count of currency volumes traded if we knew just how big some of the trades were after prices were driven to lows or to highs then we would be even more knowledgeable about whether the mms were bulls or bears any volume chart can give enough information to reasonably figure this out however even though we dont know the size of trades if the count of trades goes up then we know that was where the mms wanted the price if this is as a result of the price being driven low then we can conclude the mms wanted the price low because trading increased at the lows and if that is the case then the mms are either closing shorts at the end of a mark down phase or they are opening longs as part of an accumulation phase if this is as a result of the price being driven higher then we can conclude the mms wanted the price high because trading increased at the highs and it that is the case then the mms are either closing longs at the end of a mark up phase or they are opening shorts as part of a distribution phase in other words if the mms run the price up and following that there is increased volume of trades then the mms are bears not bulls if the mms run the price down and following that there is increased volume of trades then the mm are bulls not bears you see bullish mms do most of their accumulation while price is in a range before they break the price up out of the range sometimes they even drop the price down out of the range called a head fake to get lower prices for additional buying once they are loaded up long they are ready for a mark up run bearish mms do most of their distribution while price is in a range before they break the price down out of the range sometimes they even raise the price up out of the range called a head fake to get higher prices for additional selling once they are loaded up short they are ready for a mark down run the point is by looking more closely at those events where the mms run the price down or up by studying the volume associated with the price bars during such an event you can often see whether the mms are bulls or bears to do this you need to drop down to charts and see what the volume looks like as price is manipulated up or down then peaks and goes sideways if the volume is more substantial overall at and after the extreme prices are achieved than before the run then you can conclude that is where the mms wanted the price to go and if that is where they wanted it to go then if it went up the mms are bears that are either closing longs or opening shorts if it went down then the mms are bulls that are either closing shorts or opening longs however if price went up and then soon fell down again it is more likely the rise was buying and then the mms pulled the price down again for lower prices for more buying if the price went down and then soon went back up again it is more likely the drop was selling and then the mms pulled the price back up again for higher prices for more selling most of pa is just a mischmash of ups and downs and volume that is indeterminate so you have to be diligent you have to investigate any notable price action and move on until you come to an event that yields the information you are looking for just keeps this in mind about the mms manipulating prices there are sundry mms so one move can be followed by another and another as each mm pushes prices to new highs or lows seeking better prices for their selling or buying so we do not trade on volume information alone the way to use the information that studying volume gives you regarding whether mms are bulls or bears is to wait for the next valid sonic r setup in that direction some of this might sound tedious it isnt once you get the hang of it trading isnt easy but price action and volume together can be very reliably predictive those times when clear clues appear as close to the holy grail as anyone will ever come most forex traders shun volume and have no idea what they are missing money management for using pvsra professor tah has been telling many times how you must use small position sizes compared to what you might have been doing before i said last week that i can easily handle moves to position building direction loss side before profit side and add more and more to my position right now im building positions on gu short eu short and some exotic pairs like usdsek long and usdnok long now if we look at actual temporary drawdown cant talk about loss because this should be temporary until price goes where it is supposed to go based on pvsra in deposit currency i now have short positions open on eu micro lots € € € € € € € so € total if one goes by the rules building position and keeping sizes small who cant handle this my intention is to double positions on the way down cause then we are moving to direction that was originally read from pvsra that way im maximizing profits with building positions and minimizing losses with keeping positions small when building stage is on way so little info about money management using different trading styles here little example how i do it classic sonic r trade with sl at recent higher swing lowhigh risk is normally in range and tp in range so riskreward ratio pvsra proven classic sonic r early entry with sl at recent swing lowhigh like todays ej gj and uj trades risk is normally in range and tp in range so riskreward ratio now the building part building position the mm way is hard to put in any riskreward ratio it can be described as highest probability trading style i have come up you basically can risk anything you want here but my example is this i start building in positions from size used normally adding on position every time i think is good place to do so full and half numbers when pvsra still confirms the mms havent switched side when the price starts to move to the direction that was originally read with pvsra i add to each and every position i already have taken building this way im already at profit side when price has gone back way to direction from where the building started so different ways to trade different ways to use money management this is just an example how i do it by jrissa fire at will the enemy is being routed i have this post linked to the post by jrissa giving more details on some of the ways he manages his money position building it is a informative post it is well worth reading and well worth spending some time thinking about after you read it give time for such information to sink in it may have greater significance than one might first realize i would like to add another thought to this body of knowledge that is starting to be openly discussed unlike before when such would only have received ridicule from the doubting thomases within the retail trader group and from the spies of the mms who would not like retail traders doing anything that makes it more difficult for the mms to take their money the thought i would like to add is this jrissa talked about building a position up as the mms worked price to build up their own positions and with the plan to also add more to the position when the mms finally move the price in the profit making direction so here is the so when eu was dropping earlier yesterday i did not add there had already been talk ref worldfreedom about the possibility the mms might take price high again later and they did and to the tune of almost pips past the previous signicant high on a run off the bottom of almost pips so we must keep in mind this next statement pvsra can indicate if the mms are bulls or bears but we can never know when the mms are going to stop building and start their run for profits as a result of not adding to my eu short position as the run for profits seemed to have started early yesterday when the shit hit the fan i was able to send out several more scouts near the top of the pips run back up i responded to a question earlier yesterday that the mms might be lowering price ahead of news to coax shorters into the market on the surface that would seem not the thing for the mms to do if they are bears i mean why would bear mms encourage more bears to come in and compete for whatever liquidity for shorting is available the answer proved simple enough suck em in and wipe em out later not only wipe em out but wipe em out with nice losses which magnified the liquidity for these sonofabitch bastard mms i hope my added thought is clear we can never know when the mms have stopped building and have indeed initiated their run for profits therefore how can we know when it is safe to expend more scouts during moves in the profit making direction please think on this carefully building only when price is moving against you might be a hell of a lot safer than doing that and then expending more scouts when the price is not moving against you dont fire all the rest of your ammunition when you see you have the enemy on the run exacting entries dont need em pvsra indicates if the mms are bulls or bears bull mms can and do put on bear pa bear mms can and do put on bull pa this pa can at times as we have seen today be extreme so what this is one of the strategies we should always be expecting the mms to pull off in order to create liquidity to get more of their own orders filled it is the way of the market traders if you dont like it get out of trading on the other hand you can use any move the mms make to advantage you the same way they take advantage of it build a position along with the mms it is as simple as that but you must restrict your size of individual trades from however you are currently trading if you trade in lots then trade in minilots etc you dont need your entries to be exacting only in the same ballpark making exacting entries is impossible except by pure chance and it doesnt often happen so dont worry about it just get your position built with individual entries at decent locations the skill here is to manage entries so you do not run out of those smaller bullets before the mms run out of running the price we will never succeed at being perfect at this simply because while pvsra indicates if the mms are bulls or bears we can never know when the mms will stop running prices and initiate their run for profits trade small sizes very small relative to account size trade light and dont waste your smaller bullets too early in the game dont worry about exacting entries frankly i still stay on the record that i do not yet recommend anyone trade like this though i understand the temptation to do so if you try it you do so at your own risk so if you do you better demo it with an amount of money you might really start with and see what tweaks you need to make to your trading in order to survive you need experience with this in order to come to the knowledge based on an account size how small trade sizes need to be how many you can have open at the same time and where you need to terminate a trade gone bad i will repeat what i said in a post above jrissa recently stated he trades small enough that he can be down one thousand pips anyone trading this way needs to think about this and understand the reasoning it is better to blow one or more demo accounts until you truly understand than to blow your real money right off the bat by tah introduction pvsra and money management tradeathome pvsra stands for price volume sr analysis what makes this market analysis unique is the application of key sr levels between whole numbers to what otherwise would be just an analysis of price and volume pvsra represents a gigantic leap in getting positive results of course getting positive results is what trading is all about so lets continue with some aspects of money management when the analysis that is called pvsra is done correctly it will show you if the entities that are moving price are bulls or bears this is the single most important determination that any form of market analysis can provide and pvsra provides it realtime without the need to wait for followon price action in fact followon price action can belie the bull bear status why bulls can move price up sure but they can also move price down for better buying bears can move price down sure but they can also move price up for better selling so followon price action is definitely not what you want to be waiting for in order to determine the bullbear status of the market you might have to wait the market out until pvsra can provide a clear determination but once that is done you do not need wait longer for confirmation from anything else once pvsra has determined the bullbear status of the entities that are moving price you have all you need to know to best strategize your trading since bulls and bears move prices in both directions lets consider some strategies and some money management pvsra bull market while price trends up enter on pull downs to key pvsra levels when pvsra provides a confirming signal on that event while price trends down enter on successive lows to key pvsra levels when pvsra provides a confirming signal on that event do both and within the context of the sonic r system classic trade do or or both and only when a classic long setup or reentry follows the event pvsra bear market while price trends down enter on pullups to key pvsra levels when pvsra provides a confirming signal on that event while price trends up enter on successive highs to key pvsra levels when pvsra provides a confirming signal on that event do both and within the context of the sonic r system classic trade do or or both and only when a classic short setup or reentry follows the event immediately we see there can be multiple entries involved instead of the typical single entry classic trade or classic reentry trade your money management needs adjusting to accommodate multiple entries an easy adjustment is to switch to trading one tenth size positions if you trade in lots trade minilots if you trade minilots trade microlots by doing this you will be trading more safely because when price moves against your trade as it often will for a time you have not entered all your position in fact you can take advantage of that price move by adding other components to your trade at appropriate places as stated in the strategies above you might even initially try using one twentieth of your normal size trade this would allow you to build up a trade involving twenty components as price swings before decisively moving on in the direction intended at no time would your drawdown risk be as high as if you had made a single large entry and you can be more relaxed about where you place your entries remember pvsra is a form of market analysis and not a trading method pvsra determines if the price moving entities are bulls or bears regardless of the direction they are moving the price how you strategize to trade once you know the bullbear status of the market is up to you knowing that bulls and bears move price in both directions and that multiple entries might be involved to take full advantage of price swings your money management should involve switching to one tenth or less sized positions compared to what your normal size trades have been pvsra tutorial the pvsra project is by no means complete this is an inwork project to identify and clarify the method of analysis the analysis is a price volume sr analysis hence the acronym pvsra pvsra uses absolutely no other indicators because all other indicators are nothing more than derivatives of price they are all lagging indicators that frequently point you in the wrong direction they waste computer resources and serve only to inhibit your success that can only be achieved by properly analyzing the three most important datum in trading and then setting up your strategy to trade based on that analysis and that analysis alone the method of analysis is to look for notable volume changes then to look at the general price action pa and the individual price bars within that pa before during and after notable volume changes and finally to look to see where all this pa is taking place relative to important sr levels that is it in a nutshell but there are important specifics involved the area of important specifics involved include what is meant by notable volume changes what are we looking for in the general pa what are we looking for in the way of individual candle configurations within that pa and what are we looking for when we bring the sr factor into all of this finding out the best answers to these questions is what this inwork pvsra project is all about what works and what does not work in the following text i am going to discuss some specifics some considerations being tried in time some may be discarded as unreliable and some as yet unidentified specifics may come to light through discoveries to be made by traders that have embraced this project and are trading based on pvsra volume specifics by notable volume changes we mean relative volume changes that stand out these do not have to result in tall volume bars just taller volume bars compared to within a short time before they occur the color coded volume histogram helps to identify such notable changes regardless of the actual height of the bars which is why short bars can appear as color coded bars certainly when very tall color coded volume bars appear even among other tall volume bars this is not only a notable change in relative volume it has the possible added indication of being stopping volume this of course must be confirmed by studying the candle associated with such a volume bar relative to important sr where the end of the candle strikes can be a form of confirmation more will be said on this in the section on sr below price and pa specifics when a notable volume event occurs what does the specific candle look like and what has pa been doing in general here are some considerations if the specific candle strikes into lows or is low or is coming up off of lows in pa that is generally declining this is an indication lower prices are favored more than higher prices which implies bulls are building long positions if the specific candle strikes up into highs or is high or is coming down off of highs in pa that is generally rising this is an indication higher prices are favored more than lower prices which implies bears are building short positions sometimes the general drift of pa is neither declining nor inclining but doing both or doing neither at such times you might still be able to see if high or low prices seem to be favored however there are times when this aspect of pvsra does not yield clear results it is not a failing of pvsra it is the strength of pvsra at such times pvsra is telling you there is no clear signal and no trade entry should be under consideration by you sr specifics currently there are two sr considerations discrete sr levels and where has price come from the discrete sr levels are whole half and quarter numbers in that order of priortiy bears like to move price above these levels to close longsbuild shorts bulls like to move price below these levels to close shortsbuild longs so if price as been moved abovebelow any of these levels and notable volume changes then occur this is an indication bearsbulls reign where price has come from is also a consideration because you will see using the levels on your sonicr template and viewing charts that interday swings tend to be birthed in the area of these levels and tend to die in the area of these levels the way to use this information is to see the progress of pa from the birth of the current swing interday swings tend to be etc pips in length if a swing has just started the odds are for more progress if a swing is already mature the odds increase for price to reverse unfortunately we cannot know how far a swing might progress nevertheless this sometimes does add confirmation to what other aspects of pvsra are indicating and it sometimes boldly refutes what other aspects of pvsra are indicating for this latter situation suppose the price and volume specifics are indicating the mms are bulls with notable volumes occurring at prices at lows and maybe even in the very short term prices are starting to drift low what would you conclude if your sr part of the pvsra showed price had already performed a pips interday swing upwards could the mms be putting on bullish looking pa as part of a last effort to coax longs into the market to give the bear mms liquidity for their final round of short building before they start their run for profits downwards you see it is not just price and volume that can be analyzed sr must be a part of the analysis for the analysis to yield reliable indications conclusions as i have repeated over and over again pvsra can determine if mms are bulls or bears but we cannot ever know how far they might move price as they build their positions by screwing other traders into giving them the liquidity they need to build therefore we can never know when the mm will start their run for profits what this means is we sonicers can both build positions as the mms build or we can trade opposite the mms for example if the mms are pushing up prices and building shorts as they go we can also or we can be in a countermm long trade if the mms are pushing down prices and building longs as they go we can also or we can be in a countermm short trade pvsra is used to determine if the mms are bulls or bears once you determine that you are best able to set your strategy for trading with the mms or countermms as price achieves landmark sr levels whole half quarter levels which are good places to make your trade entries sonicer i hope this current state tutorial helps and that the effort of other pvsra traders will eventually yield a pvsra that is simple and as effective as the sonic r system it is intended to serve tah the sr in pvsra whole half and to a much lesser degree the quarter number levels are universal supply and demand areas and to which side of them that the mms move price and then increase their trading is an indicator as to whether the mms are bulls or bears so for example if the mms move price below a whole number and then increase their trading then that area has become a demand zone for the mms and they are bulls if the mms move price above a whole number and then increase their trading then that area has become a supply zone for the mms and they are bears whole and half number areas are significant demandsupply zones and one time they might be of demand and another time of supply the mms place orders for longs or shorts at such areas making them what they turn out to be the important thing is not to try and figure out in advance what they will be when price gets there but to analyze what the mms do when they get the price there are whole and half numbers the only most significant levels that were either a zone of supply or of demand when price was last there no and hansma point out that we need to be aware of such other levels not that they will be of supply or of demand as when price was last there but because if price takes off in their direction then price most likely will eventually get there once price revisits a zone of previous supply or of previous demand we can tell via pvsra what type of zone it is now if pvsra indicates the mms are bulls then it remains or has switched to a demand zone if pvsra indicates the mms are bears then it remains or has switched to a supply zone the important thing about such levels other than wholehalf numbers is not knowing what they will be supply or demand when price next gets there but to know they are possible targets once price gets there based on pvsra we will know then what the area is supply or demand for me personally i dont pay much attention to historic supply and demand areas as targets and of course i never concern myself with what they might be supply or demand should price next get there i find using whole half and quarter number levels are universal enough in that order of priority that i can trade very profitably and with a lot more simplicity interday swings tend to be birthed in these areas and die in these areas and it makes my trading life a lot less complicated to trade off of them however i do pay close attention to all of hansmas posts because he is a no messing around success doing what he does he has a lot to offer to anyone willing to listen up and learn important sometimes pvsra results are unclear and you simply must keep analyzing until they become clear using pvsra to determine if the mms are bulls or bears let’s apply some pvsra to aj as an example first look at the standard zoom chart where you will note the tl and the yellow area next let us zoom in for a closer look using the second chart on the second zoomed in chart we still see the tl and now the specific candles within the yellow area are easier to distinguish and have been remarked into two yellow areas what do we see here the first blue bull rising volume candle is relatively small yet with relatively high volume this indicates stopping volume which is another way of saying the mms are selling at the highs which makes them bears and as we clearly see they kept right on selling such that the next purple bear climax candle is large and with even higher relative volume proving the mms are indeed bears and heavily selling as a side note notice all this is happening above a whole number which is where mms prefer to close longsopen shorts finally note this started happening after the mms hiked the price above the tl which amounts to the bear mms faking longs buyers into the market so the mms could be sellers in the second yellow area we see two blue candles both striking up into the area above the whole number again clue clue clue and again on increasing high relative volumes this indicates once more the mms are bears and are hiking the price to again sucker in longs so the bear mms can short you will even notice one candle following those marked in yellow struck above the upper half number this candle seems insignificant in volume but it is bearish engulfing dont get sidetracked into the study of individual candles as that is not what is intended what is intended is that you come to appreciate that any configuration candle that might have struck up thru the half number might include a single mm order or group of mm orders representing tens of millions of currency being sold off at a perfect time and price to do so also note that pa is most recently tending to be kept above the tl is this some sort of coincidence no this is intentional by the bear mms to foster the impression of bullishness in order to continue to sucker in longs the more long traders that are tricked in by this deceit the more liquidity is provided to the mms to get more of their own short orders filled and at these very high prices position building with pvsra it is easy to determine if mms are bulls or bears what we can never know no matter what and how many indicators are added to a chart is when the mms will have completed building their positions and initiate the run for profits this is another reason it makes sense to build a position right along with the mms instead of guessing on all of the good looking setups into which you invest your entire trade size in one single shot the natural evolution in trading that is suggested by pvsra is to make a downsized shot on these good looking setups and then stand ready to add additional parts to your trades as the mms who are on the same side of the trades as you are work prices to their advantage building their own positions you build yours as they build theirs the fact is that most good looking setups do not straight away run good most of them have pullbacks before finally running good this means that by building a position you will most of the time end up with a better average ep than for a single shot entry and have smaller drawdowns not larger ones pvsra is it different from or part of the sonic r system if you have read the above you know the answer pvsra is a method of analysis used within the sonic r system to determine if mms are bulls or bears and so to be more confident of the direction of classic setups to trade certainly by knowing if the mms are bulls or bears the improved use of scout trades is possible too sonicr indicators templates until such time as the next upgrade is release be advised that post link is to the latest released tah indicators and templates which are totally adequate i suggest you use them and only them nothing else is needed moreover anything else just adds clutter to your charts and nothing of further value because how mms will move prices cannot be predicted by indicators that are nothing more than mathematical derivatives of price itself if we cannot predict using price and we cant then it is folly no it is complete stupidity to think that inventing a derivative of price will change anything volume is the only indicator other than price that is not a derivative of price this is why pvsra works it uses price volume and sr which are the three most important datum in trading nothing else adds only detracts believe it or not take it or leave it btw when i speak of pvsra i do not imply any predicting of where price goes next that can never be done reliably i speak of knowing whether bull or bear mms are behind current price movements that is as close to the traders holy grail as we will ever be some explainations in pictures by jrissa etc… a lesson in reading volume gu mms bulls or bears yes they were and are bulls heres the proof for the pic above above the dragon here and there you will see a significant green candle or a series of green candles these are where the professional traders are adding to long positions they covet the lows pricevolume analysis lesson the attached chart for ucad clearly shows two times the mms spiked the price below the half number on high activity below whole and half numbers is where the mms prefer to build long you should look at your gbp analysis look at the added pic so unless you think the mms depressed the prices just so they could have the opportunity to sell at those lows the only other conclusion you can come to isthey are buyers btw pic is a different way to view try it on for size the accumulation phase can be extensive because much time can be needed to close maybe huge short positions gradually so the mms dont raise the price on themselves while taking profit then even more time is needed to open huge long positions gradually so the mms dont raise the price on themselves while doing so the accumulation phase should really be termed the buying phase buying to close shorts and buying to open longs the mms have to do all this buying as covertly as possible because they dont want the price to go up until they are ready for it to go up get the picture pic shows the ultimate price manipulation strategy in the mms book of strategies quickly hitting the stops on longs and triggering into the market pending short orders both of which instantly create liquidity for the mms to get more of their own long orders filled before any other traders can take much advantage of the low prices to get longs for themselves pic pic pic pic pva example price and volume when used properly with sr and the highs and lows of pa swings is uncannily accurate in revealing whether the mms are bulls or are bears as i said the only thing that cannot be known can never be known is the timing of their planned breakout the picture here is very clear pa came back up thru the lower whole number on extremely high trading very bullish pa leveled off at the next half number now some mms are pegging the price back down where it runs into support at a local sr level in order to do what the phrase is buy low sell high so you figure it out what do you think the mms did when they got the price down there it is all laid out for anyone to see on the pictures already posted finally if you want an indication that might be confirming the mms are bulls from a higher tf then may i suggest you look at the pin bar on the monthly chart however how many times have we seen bull mms repeatedly step prices lower in order to capture better priced longs which in actuality was a perfect environment to trade what we see and make profits trading short how many times have we seen bear mms repeatedly step prices higher in order to capture better priced shorts which in actuality was a perfect environment to trade what we see and make profits trading long so be the mms bulls or bears though we can build a position like they do based on their stepping downup respectively the prices we can simply trade what we see which is really the message master sonicdeejay encourages us all to focus on the only two truths in trading are mms move price for one reason and one reason only to increase profits or to decrease losses mms can at any time decide to turn around the direction of price movement and take the price to whatever level they damn well can afford in order to screw others out of money in the process no indicator or combination of indicators will ever be able to divine the future decisions made by those who control market prices trading successfully requires coming to a good understanding of what the mms might be doing based on pure pa and volume relative to sr and here is a picture that illustrates both truths it shows the mms response to the earlier aud releases the mms suddenly drove the price up almost pips undoubtedly wiping out many shorts by hitting sls now the mms are bears themselves but this was a move to screw other bears and how do we know the mms are bears just look at the two red volume bars immediately following the single green volume bar clearly once the mms had the price up about pips they poured on their own orders those would be sell orders of course unless you mistakenly believe the mms hiked the price just so they could be privileged to buy more at higher prices and now the price remains high for the mms to continue shorting for as long as liquidity here exists as for the volume of the green bar that hiked the price well the mms may have had to do some buying to get the price up there but all of it easily closed for profit once the higher target price was achieved the mms dont lose on these price manipulations to get the price where they want it look at the tiny red candle near the bottom of a prolonged drive down of the price instigated by some mms now look at the volume bar associated with that candle there can only be one conclusion the price manipulating mms are extremely bullish having driven the price down to obtain lower priced longs ucad comment price volume analysis i read the pva story on as indicating the mms continue to be bulls before the ls yesterday there were two drives down red volume bars wcandles with long lower wicks with price immediately coming back up this was buying bull mms driving price down to add longs soon after the us open there was heavy buying by the us mms also tall green volume bar followed by red and blue however immediately following this the mms reversed and put on a bear drive which was sustained thru much of the rest of the day this bear drive was also bull mms driving the price down to add longs the tall red volume bar for the candle making the low of the day is the key to seeing that once the mms had the price sufficiently down they quickly increased the amount of trading they were doingbuying at the lower lows as they broke the price down thru previous sr yellow area note that there was another surge of buying as the bull mms rammed the price back up thru this sr area green volume bar and candle and then supported the price to protect their profits keep in mind that all of this was happening in a range of about only pips from top to bottom and any price within this range will turn out to be a good entry long price once the mms finally decide to begin the real mark up of the price this pip drop undoubtedly brought in a lot of shorting bears just what the bull mms needed to provide the market liquidity for them to continue adding longs the mark up phase could begin with the upcoming multiple usd high impact releases this last day of the week while we can figure out if the mms are bulls or are bears we can never know their planned timing of breakouts lets see what happens because they could put this off again for yet another week of accumulation i hope this post and others like it to follow will help sonicers that are dedicated to learning how to use volume i believe a trader can become extremely profitable if they can determine if the mms are bulls or are bears and nothing more reliably determines that than properly using volume in conjunction with pa and sr i believe once you correctly determine if the mms are bulls or are bears you will have better results trading the sonic r system setups usd upcoming releases how will the mms move prices this has to be pure speculation at this point but it is based on pva i am looking at au on the chart and i see that some mms just ran the price down to below the whole number and then poured on the buying and the price is moving back up now we know what it means when mms manufacture price drives to get prices below whole numbers that is where they like to add longs if the mms were going to respond to the usd releases by prousd moves then this au price action would not have just happened no if anything the mms would have driven prices up to add higher priced shorts if the mms are planning to respond with antiusd moves then it is totally understandable what the mms just did they lowered the price to add longs because they know prices will rise later therefore it would seem the mms are lying in wait for the usd releases with the intent that antiusd moves will follow at some point lets see how this works out for au eu and gu this is how i entered scout possible stopping vol toppish vol price went higher with lower vol price actions start to get bearish here is another lesson using price and volume to analyze if mms are bulls or bears the picture attached shows the mms price drive up in conjunction with the multiple usd high impact releases on friday were the releases responsible sometimes not quite frankly many times the mms already have their plans for price no matter what news comes out anyway two important clues about mms are revealed here firstly thursday the mms tanked the price again something theyve been doing for a month now the move down red volume bar did not attract a lot of trading a lot of trading would imply there were a lot of folks willing on both sides longs and shorts in this case the low activity really said that there were not a lot of willing shorts so the bull mms that drove the price down to add more and cheaper longs came up light and up the price did come all this clearly indicated the mms were bulls and had only a partially successful drive down to add more longs and that in itself was a huge clue the whole market is bullishfew if any shorts left secondly after the highs were attained friday you can see how the volume dropped back low right up until the previous sr area yellow was obtained by the bull mms that were doing it all over again dropping the price to get back to lows to start buying again at the sr area clearly the buying picked up red blue green volume bars so there you have it do the mms remain bulls or are they bears here is the same chart as above used something else is to be learned from the price action illustrated and that is we are not dealing with a free market but a casino run by some outfits with practically unlimited funds to use to move prices whenever and however they damn well feel like affording in conjunction with the multiple usd high impact releases friday there was this pips run up the majority of currency traded was traded by the mms market manipulators market makers large trading houses like gs large hedge funds and sometimes central banks who have huge amounts of money and credit to instantly get more when wanted so the bulk of the volume was theirs not from retailers now after the second high which was the highest high take a closer look at what happened to the trading activity as you can see activity rapidly tapered off eventually to the prerelease lows again the majority of currency traded is by the mms and you can tell right away that they traded a lot less as they worked the price back down so shall we ask the obvious question if the multiple usd releases were all that good enough so as to have the mms drive the price up pips then what in hell happened to justify the price falling back down before the day was even over justification you see market prices are determined by the mms plain and simple news comes and goes sometimes a reason for a move one way or the other but mostly just as opportunity for the mms to jerk the price around to wipe others out and steal their money this is the market prices are not based on any sensible or cohesive and intrinsic value prices are what the mms make them and the mms make prices change whenever they want by any degree they want to afford in order to wipe others out and steal their money news releases etc well they are most of the time just used for timing of some of the mms moves sometimes the mms will move prices according to the news sometimes not and often both ways and even sometimes one of two ways more than once we are not trading a free market we are trading a price manipulated market it has always been that way and it always will be because those with the most money run things and they run things their way all this being said we can still profitably trade it is all in learning how to under these conditions yen pairs mms bulls or bears using gy as an example friday the mms pumped prices again they did this the same time as they moved other pairs in conjunction with the multiple usd high impact releases not that the releases actually had anything to do with it all it was just a timing thing for what i suspect the mms already had planned for every forex pair no matter what the releases contained so the yen pairs got another pump the mms must figure on somebody waiting at the top of these pumps to buy what the mms are dumping that is the strangest part to figure sometimes if the mms are pumping and dumping step by step buying low and selling high who is conveniently on the other side selling low and buying high step by step i wont go so far as to say there is corruption here a set of double books on the liquidity providing banks computers to be settled sometime later weeks months or years down the road but it gets real hard to believe at times that everything is on the up and up no matter the higher they go the further they have to fall the critical part is not to overindulge and run the account down while not having any idea how far this gambit by the mms might take these prices are the mms bulls or bears sure looks in the near term they remain bulls step by step but i also believe each step up is a shorting place for them also they can be both buying low and selling high step by step and at the same time selling more at the tops of each step building a large short position for the eventual reversal which has massive potential in other words they are also longer term bears that is what it looks like to me short term bulls which may soon be coming to an end and longer term bears finally the highs friday were made on decreasing volume without notable high activity levels after the late day highs were attained could this be just due to not many organizations trading low liquidity for closing longs and opening shorts or and this could be a serious factor were the mms involved the only bulls around with everyone else standing on the bear side of the line which would have kept those bulls from pulling off a big take at the tops i think this is very likely if it is the case then a true reversal of the yen pairs is not far away the yen sting and the banks stink maybe maybe the banks decision statement and maybe the opinion of analysts and other talking heads can magically weaken the yen but i seriously doubt that so lets be fair and look at the other side of the coin when central banks speak folks listen up so when appropriate talking heads proclaim the yen must get weaker as part of improving an economy well folks believe and think the yen will weaken and as it does as it has folks are reassured that the banks have things well inhand and that all will come out rosy so what is the other side the other side is this the superrich control the money they control the banks the politicians and the laws that govern bank operations and these people really dont care about economies as you and i think they do they really care mostly for their own slices of heaven and preserving them and the wherewithall to grow themand to hell with the rest of the world that is after all why the world is already in a mess they caused it and if the boat sinks with the rest of us on it it wont be before they have made it to safe haven how well one way would be to get folks convinced the yen is destined to weakness talk it up and then use bank trading desks to start it off in that direction and to continue to help it along when needed then when everybody else gets really into selling the yen the central banks and the superrich get into buyingfor days week even months there are fortunes to be made here and when the bubble burstswhen everyone else discovers what the fk the yen is actually worth more than others a lot more and everyone else turns around and starts buying guess who already owns a huge chunk of the countrys coin and when everyone starts buying and causing the price to rise guess who stands to rake in fortunes you got it the banks and the superrich the very ones that created and promoted this grand yen sting the very ones responsible for the global financial collapse in the first place the very ones that are making sure if anyone comes out suffering it wont be them oh and the economy well as things always go hardworking joes will continue to work hard muddle thru and eventually things will start to turn around not because the banks and the superrich really did anything but line their own pockets but because more good and honest folks just worked harder and longer another price volume analysis another price volume analysis ucad easy to see yet another effort by the bull mms to drive price down to add longs black arrow in pic this is being readied for another mark up run it is getting late in the day london session almost finished but this is worth keeping an eye on the mms could at any time initiate the run up and a low activity time of the market such as after the ls closes makes moving price less expensive for the mms to accomplish as for sonic r the dragon is starting to angle up and so is the trend line the pa wave is an extremely nice one too see pic if the bull mms really get behind a mark up run this has a good distance it could eventually go pic price volume analysis eu this is not always crystal clear in this case i marked a couple of candles out of the rather noneventful pa that suggest the mms are bulls both are red bear candles and rather tall ones when we see such a candle the next thing we want to pay attention to is if the price subsequently moves down or up in both of these cases subsequent pa moved back up and went higher so a logical conclusion is the bull mms drove price down on these two events to add longs at lower prices that makes them bulls that are seeking to build a long position with the lowest average price possible it is also logical to conclude that at some point the mms are going to initiate a mark up run in order to make profits on their long positions keep in mind that this is just the asian session when the rest of the mms go to work later they too might drive prices down to add longs their price drives can be substantial id not be surprised if price is driven again below the half number if it is and if higher volumes follow that will be confirmation the mms are bulls and that a mark up run will be coming repeat lesson in price volume analysis i already talked about this last week in one of my posts when bull mms figure the price is too high and they dont want to keep adding at the current and higher levels their strategy is to drive the price back down and start over so naturally you will see pa top off here and there and while the volume in these topping areas might seem high later on when the bigger picture is seen it will show that when the mms drive the price back down and resume buying their net accumulation over time is a lot more than the volume at the highs it is just spread out over more time think about it and go back and find that post of mine and it is not a messy picture a messy picture is a chart with a lot of crappy indicators on it defocusing you from price and volume all that is on my chart is price dragon trend and volume and in the case of the aforementioned picture i added two yellow rectangles to help you focus as i write this the mms are driving the price back down so let’s see what happens edit add pic ok you can see the drive down and the high volume that occurred once the price was well on its way down and now the mms can continue to add longs for quite some time while the price is lower than from where it started down do you see how this will add up to a lot more volume than what looked like high volume at the previous highs i hope so gu mms bulls or bears price volume analysis lesson over a week you can see clusters of heavy volume yellow areas you can see these were all associated with the bull mms driving price low before a mark up run you can also see that in all this time the price has essentially moved up only about pips the bull mms will mark up more than that rwh is a viable target and it is also the target area of the inverted hs on the daily chart that has already been many times posted id say the mms are strong bulls on gu and more upside is coming eu comment at this stage it appears the mms might be switching from bulls to bears they executed a pump dump today even if the mms are now bears it does not mean they wont repeat this they can and usually do continue to drive prices up for a while to close longs and add shorts and for how long we can never know probably we will learn more tomorrow eg this is a pump dump and notice that the mms pushed the price up thru the half number above which is a place they prefer to close longs and open shorts is now the time for a short entry the price is still reasonably high for a short entry however later today or during the next asian session or even with the next ls the mms might again push up the price that is just something we can never know personally at this stage were it me id wait to see what happens because the mms might not be ready to push gu up nor eu down until tomorrow at the earliest and meanwhile the mms might work more on preparing to do so and eg could go back up some you make up your own mind because this could move at any time we can presume it will move but there is just no way to ever know the timing of such a thing aj mms bulls or bears easy to see that the mms pumped dumped here a bear channel what the bears do to attract bulls the bear mms drove the price above the whole number then above rdh and then followed with high selling volume as they passed their longs off to the unsuspecting new buyers that were attracted in by this fake move up this is just part of what i suspect has been going on for days now bear mms continuing to drive prices up as they close longs and open shorts and this move might not be the last one gu mms bulls or bears ok the ls is closed look at the extremely high volume with all of the candles associated with the lows early in the us session not only that but the mms got the price below the whole number where they prefer to close shorts and add longs no doubt about it the mms are bulls now note that the dragon itself has a sort of double bottom which sometimes happens and suggests a move up is imminentlate in the us session this might be worth continuing to watch eu mms bulls or bears here is my take on the price action on today the mms drove the price up this time above the next higher whole number that tf candle and all of those that followed for five more hours all struck back above this whole number this overwhelmingly suggests the mms are bears and repeatedly attempted successfully to attain prices above the whole number to close their longs and open their shorts the price has since dropped and that drop includes the highest volume tf of the entire day by my broker volume which also indicates a strong selloff from the highs even after all the activity at the highs does all this mean the mms wont attempt to drive the price back up again to add more shorts no but with all that price action above the whole number today and with the strong volume selloff from that area id not count on that area being revisited though it could be anything can happen as we well know i already have a classic sonic r short just recently opened on eu if the mms do drive the price back up sufficiently especially if back above the whole number ill simply add a scout short to the trade another lesson in price volume analysis au mms bulls or bearsanother price volume analysis lesson if one learns anything after years of trading it is thisbuy low sell high relatively speaking that is a lot of trading within a very tight candle spread and the mms intentionally pushed the price up there to do that trading that raises their average price for the position they are building so are they raising the average price of a long position or a short position you decide edit mms just did it again pic have you decided edit mms did it again pic have you decided yet if not let me suggest that you might want to give up trading uchf mms bulls or bears well gee wonder if the mms are all now closing out the trades they worked so hard to get just several hours ago after pushing the price quite low below a whole number where they prefer to add longs really do you believe that is what is happening i doubt it and i doubt it based on reason not fear and the obvious fact that the mms are still coveting the lows and increasing their trading when they get them late on a friday too ej mms bulls or bears bears you cannot properly analyze pv on alone late in ls the mms moved price back above half number that is a clue and since have been coveting the highs which indicates they continue to add shorts here’s the proof dont take long coming either look at pic after the drop you can see the green volume bar is highest volume but the green candle is not striking back down to the low or making the low what is happening the mms stopped the drop and expended their money and effort to immediately rehike the price somewhatin preparations for more shorting or to stabilize the price for the opening next week that quick dash down might have trapped some longs which might not be too worried with such a small drop what if next week opens with a quick drop and no later pullback the mms are a dirty bunch of deceiving bastards so all possibilities that jive with pa should be considered for now though there is no evidence the mms are anything but bears the mms simply stopped the drop immediately rehiked the price and resumed heavy shorting and yes even such a small rehiking of price before resuming heavy shorting means a lot of extra profit when you realize the mms can be trading millions of dollars of currency and the highest volume you saw was not at the lowest price but for the bar that started the price going back up and here is the proof the mms are bears and by manipulating the price to constantly pullback a bit they are able to get a lot more shorts on the books without the price dropping too fast keep in mind this is very late on a friday so the mms have practically no resistance to their price manipulations and they have no competition for whatever liquidity remains in the market they might suck up all the liquidity the market has right down to the lower whole number in their quest to build a short position nothing can stop them from doing it later or next week they can run the price right back up and start over again averaging out a huge position at a very reasonable price and it also suggests they anticipate such a followon mark down that they dont need to be so concerned with shorting anywhere in todays price range mms bulls or bears there is a clue i keep talking about the necessity to analyze price and volume in conjunction with sr is my instruction falling on deaf ears eu mms hit the upper whole number late in us session and continued to short it down from there until it got too low at which point the mms started the drive back up to the whole number what do mms like to do above whole numbers ej late in us session the mms sold off down from above the half number slowly step by step to get as many shorts as possible and when price got too low lower whole number they rammed it right back up to above the upper half number and had another heavy selloff the clue is sr pricevolume analysis lesson the attached chart for ucad clearly shows two times the mms spiked the price below the half number on high activity below whole and half numbers is where the mms prefer to build long you should look at your charts for these two events and see for yourself how the activity picked up once the mms got the prices low this is how to use price and volume to determine if the mms are bulls or are bears the mms are bulls on ucad putting on bearish price action as they continue to build long for an eventual move higher once you determine if mms are bulls or are bears you still wont know the timing of the eventual move they are planning for it could come at any time and sometimes not for many many days high impact releases upcoming in one to several days can often turn out to be the timing the mms plan on sometimes however the mms can put the move on hold and wait until into the next week or even beyond how the mms steal your money after selling off from the asian session highs down to the whole number area a pips selloff the mms started to support the price they brought the price back up to the tl from that time on they kept the price up against the tl feigning bullishness later after the highs had crept up along with the tl for a suitable time the mms suddenly rammed the price up even more who knows how many traders got sucked into going long then since the run up in price yesterday pa has been screaming mms distributing just look at the daily chart and see how eu has been pushed higher and higher for ever so long now and the drop a few days ago was the first substantial drop in more than a month any such drop after such a long relentless pumping of the price could be the start of a reversal and you have to consider that possibility and if prices are going lower they arent going much lower until the mms start getting rid of a lot of their longs they need others to go long in order to get rid of their longs so as price begins to show bearishness there is bound to be lots of deceptive pa put on by the mms to sucker traders to go long the mms not only need to get rid of longs but in addition they need to build shorts this requires the mms put on a lot of fancy deceptive pa to fool lots others into going long now the price is back below the tl apparently moving lower and that is how the mms steal your money the super trade here is my theory i only expressed before privately crete is the first example in modern time of a country implementing a form of currency devaluation repatriating money from the more wealthy when countries over spend and under employ to the point where the production of new wealth mining manufacturing and farming is insufficient to even pay the interest on the countrys debt there are only two known solutions start a war and take the wealth of another country or devalue currency to devalue the interest on the debt to where the production of new wealth is sufficient to cover the interest on the debt so if the world gets to that point which of the two choices do you think will be first tried lets digress briefly getting to that point could be avoided if the disparity between the rich and the poor which has accelerated in recent years could be pushed back if the goobs of money being hoarded by the superrich could be repatriated to the coffers of the countries a super tax on the superrich is needed because they are the only ones with enough money to fix the problem printing more money just pushes us all closer to the edge unfortunately the superrich control the banks the politicians and the laws governing bank regulations they are the ones that created the global crisis they are the ones that got bailed out they are the last ones willing to do the honorable thing to correct the problem they created unless the superrich are all rounded up and forced to repatriate goobs of their wealth and especially if we continue to print money we will get to the point of having to devalue currency ok now back to the subject so what is the super trade the price manipulators of precious metals gold silver etc start shorting heavily next they start moving the price lower relentlessly while their talking heads proclaim more declines coming and more declines come with the price manipulators helping the price lower whenever it falters now this wont be a short process like the yen sting will be this will be a much longer process maybe at least a few years as the price drops holders will give up and sell of course as the price drops and continues to do so as more and more folks sell somebody has to be buying who do you think are the buyers right the price manipulators such as goldman sachs jpmorgan chase probably the central banks too so where does this all end up going the bottom line is this let us suppose eventually the nations of the world have to face currency devaluation then let us suppose they dont once countries start collapsing devaluing their currency the price manipulators will have their talking heads spreading panic and that the best solution is to buyyou guessed it gold silver etc will be talked up the price manipulators will have by this time cornered the market because they have been the primary buyers in their scheme to drive prices down and get everyone else to sell now they will start talking up precious metals and driving up their prices it wont take much of either with fear spreading about currency devaluation more and more people will trade paper fiat money maybe soon to be worthless into precious metals practically overnight relatively speaking the holders of precious metals the price manipulators will see an incredible increase in the value of what they own and they will drive the price up just as they drove the price down they will make fortunes upon fortunes what if currency devaluation never comes the price manipulators will just do what they are doing with the yen first they shorted it then they started talking about the necessity for the yen to be devalued then they drove the price down down down down as more folks sold the price manipulators kept buying now they own a good portion of the countrys coin now they need to reverse price and make their fortunes so what happens yep one of the big talking heads of boj no less starts saying the yen has been devalued enough in a day or so another talking head other side of the world proclaims currency war the yen needs to be increased in value understand all these superrich folks and their banks and their talking heads are in league they are not actually in opposition it is just that now is the time for the sting now is the time since the superrich own a lot of yen to drive up the price they will make fortunes upon fortunes so if there is no currency devaluation in the future the superrich that corner the market on precious metals in the meantime will just do the same as the are starting to do with the yen first talk it up then drive it up and as more and more people also switch and start buying again the superrich will eventually make fortunes upon fortunes sound familiar you see they dont actually need the crisis of countries devaluing currencies to make this scheme work but if that were to happen then the fortunes the superrich make will be bigger and will come faster tall greenred rejection candles mms bulls or bears pva or currently vsa sheds light as to your question concerning big rejection candles i think i see the fine point you might be missing because you stated previously that green candles are buying and red candles are selling that is not necessarily the case consider this suppose price is coming to what we will later discover as a notable high a high where we later discover the mms must have planned as the area to close their longs andor open shorts suppose the chart shows a dramatic green rejection candle first striking that area of new highs was that big rejection candle buying simply because it is green when i see something like that the first thing i do is examine that area of time on the chart i want to know exactly how the volume was distributed relative to the increasing price during the time frame of that big green rejection candle it may turn out that there was less volume during the initial time when the price was starting up and a lot more volume in the ending time when the price was from half way up to the top if that turns out to be the case then immediately the suspicion occurs that because the mms saved most of their trading until the price got higher the volume was not really the volume instigated by buyers other than to push up the price it is more likely it is volume instigated by sellers and that premise being born out by the fact that most of the volume during the tf occurred at the higher not lower prices of course just the opposite sort of analysis needs be done on big red rejection candles because most of the volume might be found to exist at the lower prices when viewing the chart and if so then it was a move down instigated by bull mms seeking lower prices to close shorts andor start loading up on longs the color of candles is based on if the close is higher than the open green or lower than the open red typically called bull and bear candles respectively but this terminology while descriptive in one way can be grossly misleading when it comes to divining if the mms are bulls or bears bull mms frequently put on bear price moves so a bear candle that leaves the price lower than before might actually be the result of bull mms at work a bull candle that leaves the price higher than before might actually be the result of bear mms at work no price volume analysis is complete or even competent if it does not include a careful examination of the chart to see the price levels where the bulk of the trading is taking place during notable trading activity ej mms bulls or bears as of last thursday the mms had driven price up over a thousand pips in recent past days suddenly late last thursday after the ls closed when most forex trading has stopped what happens some mms suddenly drive the price up another measly pips to get it above the next whole number above whole numbers is where mms prefer to close longs and open shorts why the rush there should be no rush if the mms have more upside in mind for the next day and if the mms did have more upside in mind for the next day wouldnt they keep the price down and continue to add longs conclusion there was no upside planned by the mms for the next day and maybe that means the reversal is coming and some mms jumped the gun to close longs and get some shorts above the next higher whole number using whatever market liquidity was available to do so completely without interference from everyone else that had already quit for the day dont think that relative increase in volume for the drive up and immediately following while the price was kept up was not much volume any single trade could be for millions of currency and there were a lot of single trades for which that could be true all that red the next day was simply the confirmation that the mms switched from bulls to bears stopping volume is insufficient evidence to trade on i agree with you master stopping volume alone is an insufficient clue waiting for a proper hl wave to form however is also insufficient personally i think it is necessary to figure out if the mms are bulls or bears before a trading strategy is formed are you going to wait for a long or short classic setup are you going to go for a long or short scout if the opportunity presents itself dont just wait for either type trade in either direction and if it looks good then enter it that is a recipe for disaster if the mms are bulls then you want to be waiting for long opportunities of either kind if the mms are bears then you want to be waiting for short opportunities of either kind to me this is what trade what you see should mean ill stick my neck out here i think the mms continue to be bears on gold those previous stopping volume events were just to stop the drop and hike the price a bit for resumed shorting and i think the green wave up you have marked is just bullish pa put on by bear mms to hike the price again to resume shorting again i could be wrong in my analysis but lets see what happens gold mms bulls or bears i dont trade gold however if the charts on gold were the charts on any forex pairs i do trade id certainly not be a buyer as for the price being too low to short what if it turns out that gold continues to drop for the next year and a half with the only upside pa being put on periodically by bear mms that have taken profit on some of their shorts and want to replenish them at higher prices a lesson mms bulls or bears sonicers here with uj is an example of just one aspect of my pricevolumesr analysis pvsra for the sonic tah trade the chart shows a nice clean straight bullish move by bear mms right to above the whole number and immediately followed by additional high trading this is a perfect example of bears mms fabricating bullish pa in order to hike the price to add shorts remember a volume bar does not have to be all that big to be meaningful since any single trade contained within any volume bar could be for tens of millions of dollars of currency traded remember too this does not mean the price cannot go higher it can but now you know what the mms are currently doing you dont need to be involved making sonic tah trades to benefit by learning to use volume the unique way i do pvsra the sonicr vsa indicator is a sufficient tool to use in the determination if mms are bulls or bears once you do you can have a better strategy for trading in this case the mms are showing themselves to be bears hiking the price to trade more as they get the price higher since they are not buying the highs they must be selling the highs therefore they are bears so wait for the next classic sonicr short setup now with greater confidence avoid any long setups now uj and a pvsra lesson a good pullback and it actually makes pa look bullish on the surface probably just the way the bear mms want it to look bring the price back up and sort of keep it up as though it might break to the upside later and maybe they will head fake that too all this should certainly encourage more longs to the slaughter but providing right now the liquidity the bear mms need for their shorting the slaughter of the longs will come later look at see that very short candle at near the very top of the recent highs highlighted yellow now look at the volume bar who in their right mind drives price to highs and then increases their buying this is just another pvsra gem want to guess now if the mms are bulls or bears which is the point i make with pvsra there is no guessing you know with absolute certainty what the mms are doing if they are bulls or bears no other indicator or combination of indicators on the planet can match the realtime effectiveness of what we are doing here and which leads to increased profitability of trading an excellent lesson in pvsra eu mms bulls or bears dmitryfx if you are suggesting maybe the price will continue to rise from the fr level then you are suggesting the mms are bulls now switch gears from trying to get your clues from larger tf charts to lower tf charts namely look at and analyze the price and volume relative to sr in this case you will see the mms worked to drive prices above the half number where mms like to short and here they suddenly increased their trading this confirms the mms are bears adding shorts not bulls adding longsunless you believe professional traders push prices up on themselves for the glorious opportunity to buy at higher prices now please keep in mind this asian session activity does not mean the bear mms wont push prices even higher they frequently do and this may go higher for the same reason again in the ls however now we know the mms are bears and will eventually initiate their mark down run to make profits which means the price is destined to go lower than it is now enough lower such that these mms will be making profits on these shorts do you see the effectiveness of the sonic r system using pvsra you are admittedly guessing about what is going on and about what might happen later i dont have to guess i know what is going on right now and the obvious conclusion sometime later pvsra is telling me required disclaimer but i could be wrong have been before edit now look at the second a bit later you can see that the bear mms having driven the price above the half number and after increasing their trading there have exhausted the liquidity up there and now their shorting is causing the price to fall back lower again this is a perfect example of how bear mms push up price shorting as they go and continue to short away all the liquidity and continue to short the price back down this is a very neat trick as it shows how the mms go on a selling spree without ever dropping the price lower than it was when they started selling this is why i call them mmsmarket manipulators of price in a socalled free market wed expect selling like this to drive price lower but as you can see the mms sell it up sell it across as they exhaust liquidity and then sell it back down to where they started now the bear mms have bigger short positions and they never decreased the price on themselves as they built it btw any single trade in all that manipulation could be for tens of millions of dollars of currency do dont think what just happened cannot be a big deal for the frankfurt open mms the half number grab eu shorts area seems to be their cup of tea also same with gu lets see what the big people in london do the pvsra challenge gu is turning out to be the most interesting pair of all because viewing normal pa it looks bullish just look at dragon angled up and crossed up thru trend trend angled up pa above both and with the appearance of impending break up thru whole number wow on the other hand pvsra continues to show mms are bears with constant dedication to their highest trading being done at the various highest prices they achieve so the contest is on trade what you see or first determine if mms are bulls or bears then trade what you see that small body candle at the top of the mms pump has a lot of volume it is selling at the top plain and simple and indisputable so that means the mms are bears still and maybe even now are topping off pump dump the mms might save the downwards part of the dump for next week like maybe a huge gap down and relentless undermining of the price for days following absolutely slaughtering longs highly speculative based on the yen sting what is the essence of the sonic r system what is the objective of the sonic r system actually the essence of the sonic r system is trading price moves between sr areas pa waves the dragon and the trend are structures that comprise the classic setup presumed to get us into a price move between sr areas albeit late in the move eventually master sonicdeejay introduced the scout trade recognizing there are good opportunities to trade even when the dragon is not around notable volume at the end of good runs followed by sufficient pa to suggest the price is indeed reversing became a time for a scout entry opposite that last run that ended on big volume as such the scout represents another way to trade price moves between sr areas getting into a trade soon after a reversal has taken place putting the trade for the reverse direction ahead of whatever later classic setup might form for the same direction there is nothing wrong with sticking with the classic trade neither is there anything wrong with building a position using both scouts and classic trades for me i have taken the use of price sr and volume to the next level and use this most important datum of all to determine if the market is bullish or bearish if a classic fails because the market pulls price back to build before letting the classic trade run then i build with the market and sometimes i can start building with the market even before a classic setup this might become the future of the sonic r system it needs work and if it works it still needs approval by master sonicdeejay meanwhile i demonstrate it and am making good progress with it an example is shown clearly using au right now attached pic i said hours ago the mms analyzed as bulls you can see how they eventually pushed price lower to the half number area where bull mms like to build longs often this happens below the half number but not always twice the price has now bounced and according to analysis the bull mms are simply working the price up and down to build long this is a simple example of how bull mms put on bearish price moves to get price to a better area for the bull mms to add longs when they dropped the price down here to go to work adding longs i added another long to the long position i was building this is a very simple way to prepare to benefit from a price move between sr areas when the bull mms are ready to move the price from this natural sr area to a higher one i am ready with them this is after all the primary objective of the sonic r system au a pricevolumesr analysis pvsra lesson the market mms was bullish yesterday lowering prices and loading longs several times the first trading day of the week is often used by the mms to gain positions for moves later in the week now we start the second trading day of the week before upside might begin it is very likely the mms will again lower price to add longs the key sr level is the half number if the mms do lower price tothru the half number and follow the move up with higher levels of trading then as a sonicer looking for a classic trade be on the lookout for a subsequent long setup and take it a gbpusd chart shows how mms add longs the pvsra lesson continues folks it is crystal clear what the mms are doing they are taking price below one of their two most favorite levels where they like to add longs and what do you suppose they do once they the get the price there there are two possible answers buy at lows sell at lows now if you get the right answer congratulations you have a shot at being a successful trader if you get the wrong answer you dont you see since the market opened this week the mms have been bulls and have been buying and then pushing the price back down to resume buyingrepeatedly in order to build very large long positions for whatever is ahead this week the interday swing is what it should be at least pips and the drift of pa should be down if the mms are bulls which it has been when the mms do finally initiate the mark up run for profits it should be a whopper early new day notable gu activity sydney is not even open yet so who is responsible guess it really does not matter what matters is this is indeed an indication some mm is frenetically working price up and down to build or rebuild a position today could become very interesting zoom in on volume do the pvsra ok first is the pic previously posted in which there seems to be stopping volume now look at my showing another stopping volume bar within a box finally look at the analysis of that bar on the chart clearly the biggest single contributor to the overall totals was when price was almost highest indicating high selling as price came off the highs there were previously high volumes at the highs and even as price further dropped much of the remaining high volumes were while price was still about midway from the bottom overall this indicates the mms favored highs for most of their trading and therefore are bears and they are shorting and if we go back and zoom in on the stopping volume bars sonic noted look what we see pic we see here too the volume distribution clearly favored the higher prices also confirming the mms are bears new setups on yen pair island reversals man oh man these are far better than last friday now the climax volume is right where it is supposed to be so im suggesting again that the yen sting is pending and it might begin with the open next week we are talking about the most significant pure price action volume indicator in all of trading a formation undisputed by anyone attached are some examples like a hs formation this is only a possible until it starts to run unfortunately for longs in this case since an island reversal starts with a gap down by the time it is no longer a possible it is do late to save your ass if you are long i recommend all sonicers google island reversals or go to baby pipscom etc and read about this most significant formation in all of trading no wonder goldmansachs etc rolled out kuroda the key talking head again today to say all is ok what a yen sting setup interday price swings are a pvsra consideration one thing you might have forgotten or maybe had not read that i stated on some posts this month is that the interday swing is a pvsra consideration prices tend to swing in etc pip moves over some days if price has just begun a swing down the mms could well be new bears on the other hand once such a swing has made at least the minimum progress and more so as progress continues the mms could then turn bulls in your case price has just started an interday swing down sometimes pvsra results in mixed signals a sign to factor in other considerations such as the interday swing consideration sometimes nothing is clear anyway this is caused by the market not a failing of pvsra just wait dont trade continue to analyze until clear results again show up and then set your strategy for trading i’ve included a chart that shows the mms are bears repeatedly driving price above the whole number to add shorts up there and to start heavy sell offs from thereup and down repeatedly building a short position without letting the price fall until they were ready to initiate their run to build in profits i recommend you read all my trade posts and other posts on pvsra from the beginning of april and then stay up with them catching up each time you return to the thread pvsra is a work in progress i post the progress as it happens if you miss a post you might miss a key element sorry but that is the way it is until this work is finished and a finalizing document can be generated and let me repeat for all pvsra is an analysis method taking into account price volume and sr all the key elements of trading and for the purpose of determining if the mms are bulls or bears the result is intended to be used to better decide how to trade classic setups and to better select scout entries it is not intended to change the sonic r system but to improve it eu mms bulls or bears this shot of the chart now that the asian session is well underway shows that in the boxed area above the sr half number the highest volumes are for price striking up to highs price at highs price falling off from highs all indicating the mms are favoring the highs to sell at and to start selloffs from therefore the mms are bears the ls mms might seek these price levels themselves or even higher levels if you study more closely and more carefully you will see that the highest trading occurs when price makes relative highs and also as the high selling causes price to fall off the relative highs you need to be very careful and precise with your analysis if you do not find clear results do not trade if you are position building it is imperative you have properly determined if the mms are bulls or bears or you will end up trading against them remember what ive said you can trade countertrend just dont trade counter mms personally i half expect folo or us mms to hike the price even higher above the sr half number maybe all the way to the upper sr whole number this is after all just the first day of the week and a time when the mms frequently move prices to their advantage for whatever they might have planned for during the week not always but often enough to be very careful i dont have any eu positions for the week yet and i want to see more before i start building if i start building which will take price and volume and sr analysis that is conclusive and time for the mms to run the price to extremes maybe before i start a pvsra lesson with eu suppose pvsra indicates the mms are bears and now we see price raising sort of a classic setup on a big pa wave does it make sense to have a long setup if the mms are bears is pvsra wrong think about this if the mms want to build short do they not need longs coming into the market yes they do so the higher the mms hike the price the more longs come in and the more the mms can build short at higher and higher prices too what a deal time and again classic setups have been profitable even though the mms were actually on the other side of the move building their positions for an opposite move the pvsra breakthrough is that we know what the mms are so now we know when trading a classic setup if the mms are with it or are against it we can trade regardless but that added information just makes us more aware of what is really going on since it is the first trading day of the week and because early pvsra indicates the mms are bears i want to see the mms run the price for a ways and see if the pvsra results remain consistent before i even think about trading so far on this current move up pvsra continues to indicate the mms are bears with higher trading at each new plateau the mms take the price up to see attached let’s look at this situation again firstly since the market opened for the week pvsra came up with good indications the mms were bears and this continued to be the results of pvsra not only at the time of the classic long setup but throughout the breakout run upwards what can we make of this two things come to mind you can take a classic trade and do well even if the mms are building for an opposite move in fact if the mms intend to drive the price up to coax in longs to give the mms the liquidity at ever higher prices to build short then it assures the classic setup will result in a good run the downside here is that not all good looking setups run good if the mms are bulls and the classic is long then the results should be good even if there is a pullback first and you can use scouts on the pullback to build long on the other hand if the classic is long and the mms are bears it really doesnt always work out that the bear mms will hike price far to build short making the classic long a good trade the bear mms might very quickly initiate a profit run leaving the classic long in the red and with no way the scouts can help you can trade along with the mms building a position along with them to my way of thinking involves a lot less risk youre trading along with the mms and it is the mms that know whats what now and whatll be what later and the past four weeks of trading this way have been the best weeks of my trading i took short scout already because it seemed so obvious that they pump the price up to get shorts now we are above half number and trading is getting some volume in although i am thinking they might be getting this above full number before mark down that would be good place to start mark down rdh daily resistance area on the chart we can see how volume stays up without price continuing to go up after each fast pump up another lesson on pvsra the thing to adjust to is that pvsar is not just an analysis of price and volume no sir it is the analysis of price volume and srand that makes all the difference in the world you see i pointed out the mms took the retrace up thru the sr whole number and there it is plain to see they did a shit load of trading at the highs obvious heavy shorting is what they did and there is where the best short entry was to be made pvsra is far more reliable than pa waves when building a short position using pvsra you dont need to wait for pa waves as you show pic because compared to pvsra they are just another lagging indicator pvsra the difference between guessing and knowing pvsra on is a way to know if the mms are bulls or bears and is indicating the mms are bears as always the unknown and what can never be known is how far mms will take price before they initiate their run for profits bear mms lust after the area above whole numbers so there is a good chance price will end up there before the next profit making run down there is still plenty of time before a profit making run might begin so for pairs such as ej eu gu the mms can keep price away from the area above the whole numbers and exhaust the patience of other traders causing them to give up waiting and enter below the whole numbers that way when the mms finally do push prices above the whole numbers there will be less competition for the liquidity up there personally i am waiting for prices to break up through whole numbers before adding to any pairs i have trades on however if it doesnt happen it really wont matter because any price nearby will be plenty good once these start profit making runs to the downside pvsra lesson au us mms load up with shorts right after us open pvsra lesson ej large tf candles can indicate a move is coming but by the time they confirm the move it has already traversed lots of pips pvsra is the answer not even using a fibo retrace is as reliable as pvsra pvsra indicates if the mms are bulls or bears with fibos your still guessing now if one uses pvsra in conjunction with fibonacci retracements pvsra ej pvsra ej yesterday the mms hiked the price above the upper half number and did a humongous amount of trading in that region which therefore was obviously selling today ahead of eur news the fo hiked the price above the whole number and increased trading which therefore was obviously selling since then pvsra continues to indicate the mms are bears so what is all this talk about longs frankly i am willing to believe many of these mms already have spied out the news they know full well what is coming and start building in advance of it for your information insider trading is not illegal in the forex market so you can damn well bet that news is ferreted out by the mms before release whenever they can do it pvsra a winner a huge whipsaw by the mms for liquidity for their shorting ram the price up to stop out shorts and trigger wrong side pending long orders then ram the price down again to stop out those longs liquidity it is all about the mms getting liquidity to fill their own short orders no doubt can there be now which way the profit making run goes by the looks of this whipsaw effort the mms put on it could be a doozy too pvsra of ej a review lets take a close look at what a pvsra of shows us about the market the mms the market manipulators just before the us open the mms dropped the price about pips this resulted in two things happening shorts were encouraged and some longs got stopped out which created liquidity for the mms who do you think had the most short orders set before the move started next the mms raised the price about pips this resulted in two things happening some shorts were stopped out and longs were encouraged and pending long orders were triggered these actions created liquidity for the mms would mms be buying or selling into a rising price next the mms dropped the price about pips this resulted in two things happening shorts were encouraged and pending short orders were triggered and at this point you might be asking who had the most pending short orders waiting to be filled and some longs were stopped out creating even more liquidity for the mms finally note where the price landedright back from whence it started look again now you will see that most of the action today took place higher not lower than the whole number area it all started at and ended at so ask yourself this question if mms ran price higher for a time to get orders filled were they bulls or bears to help you answer this question here is a statement you might use buy low sell high pvsra indicates the mms had been were during this whipsaw today and still are bears now they are more fully loaded with short positions and we are getting closer to the time these bear mms initiate their run for profits the second pic pretty much sums it up pvsra ucad pvsra aj dont wait for big pips pvsra indicates the mms remain bears they are just involved in a retrace ie they are pumping up the price to get higher prices to short at the bear mms now have price above the half number and pvsra shows highest levels of activity at the higher prices while the mms hold the price above the half number im not saying it cant go higher it can pvsra determines if the mms are bulls or bears nothing can determine when the mms will cease moving price one way and initiate their run for profits the other way pvsra ucad progress report pvsra gu pvsra does indicate the mms remain bears not on however which is not yielding clear results is yielding clear results btw the dragon has nothing to do with pvsra and price is not currently above the half number it is below it clearly shows the bear mms previously moved price above the half number loaded up and later drove the price back down thru the half number all the way down to the lower whole number since then the bear mms have instigated a retrace to get back to some higher levels for renewed shorting the bear mms have hiked the price back above the sr level and up here is where higher trading levels are kicking in so pvsra is clearly indicating the mms remain bears pvsra uj when price was in the lower range pvsra on shows notable volumes are associated with the higher prices and with the drop in prices from those highs hence the mms favored the highs to load up at and to sell off from indicating the mms are bears now with price in the upper whole number area the same is happening the mms are repeatedly pushing price above the whole number and selling off from there things are not crystal clear as they sometimes are due to current market conditions flat i will say this however you made no mention of any pvsra on any chart other than you cannot do a competent pvsra without also doing so on andor and i have said this before because pvsra is not crystal clear there is doubt it could behave like the other yen pairs which are bearish on the other hand if the mms plan to respond later to us releases as though the data is strong even if it isnt so strong this particular yen pair might get a bullish move the uncertainty here due to the upcoming usd releases is why i have no interest in taking any position on it jpy bank holiday during the second tf of the asian session on this last day some mms quickly did some fancy trading look at an chart and you might find that in the last two weeks of trading there are only other hour bars with higher levels only in all of weeks including london and us sessions none of the other yen pairs have this magnitude of trading but they all have increased levels of trading at some point within the first several hours of this last asian session gj though clearly an exception by showing such a high level of trading might nevertheless be a clue that something is up so maybe there is more to this possibility than we thought the main issue is ourselves it is not the market it is not the indicators it is not the methods we are told and programmed to look for certainty remember mkt doesnt really work that way mkts are basically the representation of millions of traders trading against each other trader a he spends weeks of research on a security and place a trade it is high chance of the trade will end up profitable but there are certain probability that the trades will turn loser too trader b he spend minimal research and place a trade he has certain probability of making it winner even though the trade mostly to turn soar so high degree of uncertainty is the name of the game here no such thing as sure in the market as no one can predict so accurately all the time once you accept that fact you trading will be must easier we are just using waves dragons and volume to add up our chance of getting the right entry in the right direction and good money management to let my winner ride and cut my losers fast yesterday move in euro pairs eg eurjpy is the very best example i was bullish few hours before rate decision and i had longs and it spike up with hundred pips so my instinct kicks in started to lock in my profit when it turns back my money management help me to bag about pips i added few shorts from high ride down the slide professor tah was bearish for this week and he was building positions for sometimes now he know the risks well and good at managing them when it spiked up he didnt close immediately in panic as he know where are the red flag zones are so he didnt get whipped either or even he may added nice shorts at the high we both cannot predict the mkt with accuracy for sure we are on the opposite sides but we are both trained enough to act accordingly at any given situation so the morale of the story is we need to knowaccept the nature of the game which is uncertainty and turn it to our advantage with the very toolsmethodsmanagement that we have i hope it will blow a light bulb or two pvsra shows what the mms do best the mms suck in shorts with sls while they themselves short red bar down then the mms stop out the shorts with sls and suck in longs again both providing for more liquidity while they themselves continue to short green bar up finally the mms hold prices high and add more shorts so long as deceived longs supply the needed liquidity eventually these longs will also begin to be slaughtered when the bear mms initiate their run for profits all this manipulation of price by the mms market manipulators was accomplished in concert with the usd releases this example all by itself should explain to news buffs the folly of paying any attention to the content of news in order to figure out how the price will move trading with pvsra the following pictures are all in real time examples au short trade entered short scout this is based on pvsra showing mms hiking price above half number with higher trading and on the obvious fact shows

best trading lessons how much to invest dont invest at the cost of ruining your life your investment should always be an almost insignificant amount if you lose it it should hurt a bit but not ruin

without following the two tools of capital preservation i stop loss ii risk management both these tools are far more complicated than they sound read understand and only then trade dont be a hero to fight the trend dont try making quick trades by fighting the trend use the weekly time frame and the day moving average to find the trend and trade only in the direction of the market no good assets there are no good and bad assets dont get attached to a coin or a stock your aim is to make profits to buy low and sell high follow emperorbtc keep your logics attachments and emotions away and trade the chart eg cardano is shit but i made good money there exit at the first sight of bearishness dont pray for a trade to go right dont hope your aim is to leave the market asap once the trade goes the opposite direction dont give control to the market and keep hoping exit start afresh cut your losses keep them small plan dont trade if you dont have a planned entry exit and invalidation point listening to opinions of others will always get you rekt dont even listen to me you have to plan your entry position size and invalidation points its simple yet most difficult trading is easy you dont need complicated tools and monitors my mentor still trades with sr lines volume on his laptop the catch is you need a plan manage position size predetermined entries exit on invalidation cut losses trade more when learning trade a lot a lot trade with the trend as many times a possible your methods need real market testing trade more let the market give you feedback as much as possible the only way to get better at freethrows is to keep practicing learn learn learn trading is the most rewarding profession ever you cant expect it to be easy journalise all trade take notes and keep learning i have made tutorials for all topics here it works its free follow emperorbtc these are some of the rules off of my head that you must follow please dont try to fight them its better to learn from others mistakes than commit them you can scroll through my twitter and telegram to find all the tutorials it will take some efforts but its worth it follow emperorbtc introduction to technical analysis trading bitcoin masterclass part introduction in the next few days we are going to learn to trade bitcoin for profits i will keep in mind to keep it as short as possible making it completely comprehensible for extreme beginners terminology before you learn to trade we must know the true meaning of a few terms i have written down the most important terms and tried to explain them in the simplest manner possible if youre a new trader please go through them people who already trade can refresh their understanding where can i see the charts there are several websites i use tradingviewcom simple easy and offers everything most people need you don’t need a paid version the basic free version is enough bitcoin million satoshis million bits exchange in terms of crypto a marketplace which allows buying and selling of bitcoin or other coins egbybitbitmex fomo fear of missing out a trade all beginners do it they enter a trade without enough research in the fear of missing out profits total supply the amount limit of coins that will ever exist supply limit of bitcoin is million bull is someone expecting the price to go higher and bear is the opposite follow emperorbtc bull market a market where the prices are seeing a continuous uptrend leading to new highs being created generally happens when new investors enter the market bear market a period where the prices are seeing a long term down trend leading to a sell off see the chart below note a bull market can have many bearish cycles and vise versa as shown below market cap the market capitalisation of an asset calculated by current supply of coins multiplied by cmp of one coin follow emperorbtc bubble a situation where the prices are irrationally high as compared to the actual value of the asset whole of an asset could be a bubble or a market cycle could be a bubble eg theranos as an assetcompany was a bubble fud fear uncertainty and doubt day trading taking a position in the market either buy or sell and exiting it the same day eg mcafee announcing in that binance had been hacked was a fud swing trading this method looks for buying and selling positions in a weekly range swing traders make my traders a week most of my trades are swing trades positional trading the aim is to buy monthly lows and hold them for days weeks or sometimes months this is a longer term trading time period day trading taking a position in the market either buy or sell and exiting it the same day leverage refers to the extra amount of asset bought or sold over your capital limit eg if you buy of bitcoin with a capital of you have a leverage of sites like bitmex allow leverage as per your choice margin the amount of funds required to open a leveraged trade eg if you want to open a position of with a leverage of your margin requirement would be x long position this is a buy position buy with leverage eg if you have as capital you could buy worth of bitcoin with leverage or even more both profit and loss in this case is multiplied by the leverage you take eg a risefall in price in case of a long position with leverage will lead to profit or loss short position exact opposite of long entry you enter a short entry when you expect the prices to fall shorting allows you to make money in a bear market volatility it is the percentage movement in price of an asset over a period a balanced volatile asset gives ample opportunity to short and long traders look for predictable volatility a very highly volatile or low volatile assets isnt considered good for trading follow emperorbtc roe returnonequity this is calculated by the actual capital employed in a trade and not through leverage ohlc open high low and close altcoin all coins except bitcoin bull trap a technique used by market makers to buy a huge amount suddenly spiking the price this makes everyone else that this is a breakout and everyone buys they market makers then sell enormous amounts pushing the prices down in turn liquidation everyone else that had bought producing a cascading effect of liquidations bear trap is just the opposite of the above for making the prices go higher in the end askbid sell orders are asks and buy orders are bids spreadthe difference between what the sellers are ready to sell at and what the buyers are ready to buy at there always exists a small spread on all exchange the higher the liquidity the lower the spread eg in the below situation the spread is dollars see pic below of an order book explaining the above terms follow emperorbtc support and resistance a support is a zoneline where we can expect the price to bounce back up resistance is a linezone where we can expect the price to rebound downwards we will study this in the next lessons walls extremely large orders at a range demand zone a zone with huge buy orders this is determined through the heat map supply zone a zone with huge sell orders this is determined through the heat map stoploss order that is triggered when the price goes below this point used to cut losses supportresistance liquidity the measure of how actively the coin is being traded in the market a high liquidity coinexchange has many buyers and sellers at the same time making it easier to acquire or sell the coin at any time uptrend a price is said to be in an uptrend when its making higher highs and higher lows it can be confined in a channel channel uptrend and higher high and higher lows are shown in the chart below the chart below showcases an uptrend an uptrend channel and higher highs and higher lows downtrendopposite of uptrend the prices here make lower highs and lower lows consolidation a period where the price is ranging in a welldefined region this is a period of indecision and generally leads to a volatile movement in either directions correction a correction is a fall in price after making a new peak or an upwards rally many authors define the correction as drop from all time high but its arbitrary follow emperorbtc sideways market an indecisive market which isnt leading to a breakdown or a breakout and not giving any signals in either way sell off profit taking after a rally in price which leads to lowering of price of the asset rally an upward trend leading to increase in price of the asset can happen in both bear and bull market accumulation the process by which one builds a position in an asset pattern a chart pattern is a predefined shape that have been historically studied by technicians traders try to use these previous performance statistics to predict future price movements eg a head and shoulders top is considered bearish there are many such pattern which will be fractal a pattern of price movement which has occurred earlier and might occur again limit order order will execute at a predefined price if the market riches that price market order an order to buy or sell at the current price level executed immediately time period time frame the time spread of each candle stick in a chart common time periods are min hour daily and so on ath alltime highs prices average down trying to lower the average entry cost of a position by slowly buying the asset at reducing rates liquidationwhen you are stopped out of your position because the trade went in the opposite direction and your margins are not big enough to carry the trade anymore arbitrage a method of making profit using the pricing difference between exchanges eg if bitcoin is trading at on bitstamp and on bitfinex people will buy from bitstamp and sell on bitfinex follow emperorbtc premise of technical analysis now that weve completely understood a few important trading jargons lets begin with technical analysis technical analysis is the use of charting techniques to predict future price movement it uses previous human reactions to a similar situation to predict future price movements only price movement it taken into consideration while using technical analysis all other information like news earnings is not taken into consideration it might come as a surprise to all new traders that news is disregarded while studying charts murphy in his book on technical analysis explains in detail why it is so to keep it short the price discounts everything market price of an asset already has taken into consideration all the fundamental news news information and other analysis available in the public already have affected the price and hence the price is an amalgamation of all the fundamental information technical analysis is the study of price hence by studying price all the fundamentals have already been taking into consideration hence we can conclude that all the fundamentals affect the price since the technical analysis is the study of price movement it automatically takes all the fundamentals into consideration follow emperorbtc candlesticks technical analysis starts and ends with candlesticks a clear understanding of candlestick is a must to trade while the subject of candlesticks is really vast there are only a few basics you need to understand the candlestick is used instead of a line chart because a simple line chart doesnt tell the movement at a given period of time whereas a candlestick tells you the high low open and close at a given time period there are of kinds of candlestick and it’s an unending study but to start with i want to explain two important candles hammer the engulfing hammer in simple terms it’s a bottom reversal candle with a short body and long wick this can be spotted at potential bottoms follow emperorbtc engulfing this occurs after a move is invalidated because of a sudden price movement in the opposite direction by the next candle example below the basic concept and assumption while studying the candlesticks is that a candle with long tail wick has seen the buyers being successful in pushing the price up by buying at this price level even though there was a significant selling a candle with a short body long tail wick denotes supply absorption similarly a candle with a long overhead wick is bearish and shows that even though the bulls tried to push the price up the supply was too high for the price to go up follow emperorbtc adding the above two we can conclude that a candle with a short body and with both a long upper wick and a long lower wick is a candle denoting indecision and confusion in the market it might denote a reversal or could act as a warning for an end of a trend in this tutorial we will learn to identify the supply and demands zone on the chart for entering high probability trade before learning anything else this the topic to master after reading this tutorial please open a live chart and try to identify the supplies and demand zones using candlesticks to find demand and supply apart from using candlesticks to identify price momentum in a certain time period candlesticks can be used to identify the demand and supplies zones demand and supply zone is different from support and resistance using candlesticks to find the demand and supply zone is a high probability method to find a profitable entry since in the demand and supply zone there can be multiple entry triggers the aim after identifying demand and supply zones is to enter at a point which has multiple entry triggers at one point finding supply and demand pressure using candlesticks candlesticks can be used to find supply and demand pressure especially in intraday trading i hope this changes how you view and use candlesticks on a daily basis candlesticks with a long tail wick about times their body have overcome a big supply zone this means that below that candle existed a huge supply order which was absorbed this is generally bullish means the demand in that zone was able to overcome the supply follow emperorbtc at this zone traders could look for a safe long entry look for candles with a long tail it should have bounced off of a previous resistance now turned support we will learn more about support and resistance in the next lesson for now only concentrate on demand and supply zone wait for the price to break a resistance above the same principle is applicable with candles with a long overhead wick this implies that the candle was not able to absorb all the supply above itself which is generally bearish we should look for signs of reversal at this level follow emperorbtc in a similar manner on confirmation of a candle which failed to absorb the supply above a safe short entry can be made look for candle with long overhead wick wait for previous supply to be broken see pic below for a short entry confirmation a confirmation in trading is a positive signal to establish a bias for for an entry example if the current candle looks bullish a safe entry with confirmation would be when the price on the next candle goes above the highest price of the set bullish candle retest after a price breaks a certain resistance it comes back to the point where the resistance was to establish that the resistance has been broken and the same resistance has now been turned into a support for the price structure let us try to understand the trade by using the following concepts of demand zone supply zone uptrend line a detailed tutorial will be uploded on this breakout retest confirmation follow emperorbtc how to find a short entry after a supply zone long overhead wick candles generally denote supply wait for them to close at same level find new support wait for it to break wait for support to turn into resistance enter short trade upon confirmation follow emperorbtc so in this tutorial we have learned the concept of supply and demand and how to identify on chart to reiterate the use of supply and demand once mastered is the most useful tool to find high probability trade entry most beginners learn it very late hence are unable to identify high probability entry zones it must be noted that supply and demand zone is not a tool for entering a trade but a tool for identifying the zones and areas of interest for high probability high profit trade instead of spending too much time to identify the kind of candle stick that has been printed on a chart we should rather concentrate on what the candle is trying to say about the demand and candle structure as a trader our soul aim is to identify the trend whether the demand and supply is more and enter it please read this tutorial several times and try to identify the zones on your own on historical chartsdo not worry about finding the entery points right now only try to identify the zones finding entries will be taught in the next lessons i hope this tutorial was useful this is the first trading lesson don’t worry or give up if you didn’t understand a few concepts always here to help love emperorbtc follow emperorbtc introduction to candlesticks trading bitcoin masterclass part deep dive into candlesticks part in the previous pdf we studied demand and supply zones introduction to candlesticks in this pdf we will cover candlesticks in some more detail discussing the major candlesticks and their types importance of candlesticks technical analysis starts and ends with candlesticks without proper understanding of candlesticks you should not be trading please note candlesticks are the most important tool in technical analysis however i always use them in confirmation with other confirmations like support and resistance and volume using candlesticks without risk management will always lead to liquidation risk management is far more complicated than you think ive made masterclasses about risk management please read them before trading nothing can teach you to trade but trading itself as soon as youre done reading this pdf go and practice the content on live or historical charts and observe how volume and sr play a role in them while there are of types of candlesticks im sticking to the most important ones that are actually practically used in trading follow emperorbtc tip dont get stuck in memorizing the names of the candlesticks you need to understand the logic behind their formation and use that understanding to predict the future prices basic candlestick understanding the fat part of the candle is called the candle body candle open to close the thin line above and below the body is called the wick highs and lows general assumption the longer the candle body is the more intense the buying or selling pressure conversely short candlestick bodies indicate little price movement and represent consolidation wicks plays a really important part in understanding the story behind the candlesticks it shows the fight between the buyers and the sellers and who won it in continuation we will learn to read the wicks follow emperorbtc no wicks candles existing of full body and no wicks showcase the highest buying and selling pressure these are known as marubozu candles example follow emperorbtc long wicks long upper wick candles with long upper wick and short body below denotes that even though the bulls tried to push the price higher the sellers took control and there was just too much supply at this point to push the price up long lower wick candles with long lower wick tail indicates that the bears tried to push the price down but the selling pressure was absorbed and the price managed to go up follow emperorbtc spinning top spinning top has long top and bottom wicks with a narrow body this implies indecision in the market however if a spinning top appears at the top or bottom of the trend it means a trend reversal this is explained in the chart below follow emperorbtc doji there are many types of doji candles but we will focus on the concept of a doji a doji is identified by a narrow body and long wicks it means that the price closed and opened at almost the same price this means grave indecision in the market doji needs to be only relied upon after further confirmations from volume this further confirmations and confusing concepts like dragonfly and gravestone will be discussed later however a doji can have a different meaning depending on where it occurs the proportions of the wicks follow emperorbtc a trade involving the doji candle is explained below hammer a hammer is regarded as one of the most important reversal tools it occurs at reversals and signifies the end of a trend the candle is marked by a long wick and an almost narrow body with small or no upper wick follow emperorbtc conclusion long candle body more intense buying or selling pressure short candle body consolidation long bottom wick sellers trying to push the price down but not succeeding long top wick buyers trying to push the price up but not succeeding narrow body and same proportion wicks indecision and could also mean the end of the trend long wick and thick body occurring at the bottom or top of a trend trend reversal if combined with volume follow emperorbtc a tip go to tradingview and use the candlestick pattern indicator to automatically identify the candle types ps the indicator is no substitute for any form of learning identification doesn’t mean being able to use the information invest in your knowledge this was an intro to deep dive into candlesticks we will completely master the over time always here to help love emperorbtc follow emperorbtc support and resistance mastering horizontal support and resistance for trading bitcoin this is the most comprehensive realworld guide to support and resistance this is everything that you need to master it it’s an exhaustive guide don’t read study it introduction sr must be the most underrated tool in trading which isnt given enough time or attention by most beginners many successful traders personally known to me rely solely on sr this should speak enough for its importance we will study the following follow emperorbtc focus of study understanding sr identifying and drawing a valid sr nature of sr when it breaks fake breakoutbreakdown identifying entryexit at sr lines how institutional traders stop out retail traders stop loss hunting high probability entryexit sr can be categorized as an area of supplydemand which acts as a probable zone for entry exit trending support and resistancetrendlines horizontal lines denoting a price of either support of resistance we will be studying these horizontal lines in this thread follow emperorbtc definition a support line indicates a price where the buying pressure is more than the selling pressure acting as a base for an upward bounce of price to elaborate the demand is greater than the supply at these levels hence an upward move in price is generally probable drawing a support line a good starting point is to zoom out on the time frame that youre trading and try to touch as many lower points as logically possible the support should be easily visible upon minor observation and you shouldnt have to hunt or look hard for them follow emperorbtc comment it’s practically acceptable if the support line crosses a candlewick or doesnt touch the wick or only touches the wick the support line doesn’t have to be perfectly aligned we are mostly looking for zones rather than a perfect straight price line the examples below illustrate the support line overlapping with candles and wicks or not perfectly touching the candles in both these examples the support line is valid follow emperorbtc resistance resistance line indicates the price where the selling pressure is higher than the buying pressure to elaborate the supply is greater than the demand which pulls the price lower there’s a good probability of price retracing from this price line just like support line zooming out on the time frame that youre trading and try to touch as many high points the resistance should be easily visible upon observation and you shouldnt have to hunt or look hard for them examples of resistance lines below observation the chart above also shows a vital concept of fakebreakout breakout retrace and confirmation it will be explained later in detail understanding breakdown and breakouts a breakout occurs when the resistance line is tested several times leading to an increased demand in that price zone this increase of demand leads to a breakout follow emperorbtc opinion the more times a resistance is tested the weaker it becomes breakdown it is when the support zone is tested too many times leading to an increase is supply at that price point which leads to lowering of price ie breakdown pic opinion the more times we test a support the weaker it becomes see pic below follow emperorbtc what happens if a support or resistance line breaks they start acting in the opposite nature a support line becomes a resistance and a resistance becomes a support this above concept is of utmost importance in understanding and confirming a trend resistance lines when crossed become new support and the cycle repeats until the trend breaks pic study this chart carefully to see how resistance level when broken at after formation of a new resistance at becomes a new support at follow emperorbtc this cycle continuous till the breakdown take some time to understand the above graph uses of support and resistance intuitively the use of the support line would be to enter a long when the prices bounces off the support line and that of the resistance line would be to go short when the price pulls back from resistance follow emperorbtc however real world trading isn’t this simple and the above usage needs understanding of the following • breakouts breakdown • fake breakdownbreakout • retests • confirmations • stoploss hunting these are explained below one of the more profitable ways to use support and resistance is to use them at the breakdownbreakout zone a breakout leads to a strong upwards rally in price because of a huge demand at the resistance zone long at the breakout follow emperorbtc the exact opposite is true for breakdown which leads to a big pullback in price short at the break down see pic below for breakout and breakdown advanced uses of support and resistance in determining high probability entry below i illustrate the advanced practices used by seasoned traders to determine high probability entries for profits however they are easy to understand upon a repeated reading here we will study fake breakouts and fake breakdowns stop loss hunting study of the above will help us understand how institutional traders stop out the retail traders and provide us with a probable solution against stop loss hunting institutional traders stop out both long and short retail traders at the same time at a similar price zone a very common problem that retail traders face is being stopped out let us understand stop loss hunting in detail follow emperorbtc short hunting at resistance the red line denotes the resistance line at point a few retail traders will short it thinking that the price will go down at the resistance but the price has a small breakout out triggering the stop loss of the people who went short this is a fake out as the price then reverses at the resistance even though the price goes down the stop loss gets hit here the trader loses money even after being right this is short hunting with the same chart we will study long hunting at the resistance the wick crosses above the resistance line most retail traders will long here calling it a breakout the price is then reversed stopping out all the longs this is long hunting at the resistance follow emperorbtc the same exact stop loss hunting is done at the support stop loss hunting for longs and shorts at the support can be seen here this is illustrated in the charts below now that we have understood that taking longshort entries at the support and resistance can get you stopped out let us look at the probable solution first solution is to look for the following breakoutbreakdown retest follow through the process of confirmation and retest can be used for both long and short entries confirming the breakout confirming the breakdown confirming the support confirming the resistance follow emperorbtc this chart explains the retest and confirmation of support in this chart the support is established then the price comes back to be retested and the support is held and confirmed this confirms the support line leading to an upwards rally in the same manner a breakout from a resistance can be confirmed as shown in this chart the resistance is broken the price comes back to confirms the breakout and is confirmed on confirmation a high probability long entry is made follow emperorbtc solution after a breakout or a bounce from the support like wait for the price to break another resistance above the support line or the breakout levels see the example below for entering a long after a bounce at support and break of resistance the same concepts can be applied for going short at resistance or breakdowns the above concepts will help all beginners from stop getting hunted by an institutional order block this module has covered all the information you need about horizontal support and resistance in great depth i will share trendline support and resistance and supply and demand zone tutorials soon study it multiple times and you should be good to go follow emperorbtc risk management part part how not to lose your money please retweet it might help a trader from losing it all fact of the traders lose money we will learn how to be in the top by mastering risk management in the next few threads the most important but most ignored concept according to me all of trading knowledge is futile if you dont follow risk management period since of the traders lose money due to lack of risk management we dont need to further discuss its importance if we dont manage risk mathematically we will for sure lose all the capital for sure in this thread we will try to understand optimum position sizing the rule never risk more than of your portfolio on a single trade is what i prefer is an aggressive approach this might sound bizarre a waste of time but lets understand it further trading with only of your capital doesnt mean your tradeposition size is only of your total capital what it means is that youre risking of your equity in a single trade whatever happens you will not lose more than of your equity on a single trade trade size will be determined by the leverage on that equity this is illustrated in the note below notice how equity at risk of becomes a position size of by risking just follow emperorbtc caution this is just an illustration we will learn to use leverage later leverage usage is a function dependent on the stop loss determined based on ta i use only technical analysis to determine the stop loss and the leverage multiple shall be determined by it we will learn the application of leverage in the stop loss thread but why risk so little capital per math even if you have a very high strike rate ratio of winning trades eg there will come a time when you will have consecutive losing trades high equity risk trades are historically proven to deplete all capital as explained below the chart below shows the consecutive losses a trader will definetely face over a period of time with the given hit rate now imagine if someone with a respectable hit rate of risked of his capital follow emperorbtc in each of the losing trades rekt it might come as a surprise that the most successful and long term traders have a strike rate of around the best traders that i know personally and even myself dont have that high of a hit rate then how does such low strike rate lead to profits in the long run follow emperorbtc the profitability is gained from obtaining a good rr risk to reward ratio over a period of time rr stop loss placements and the use of leverage will be explained in the next threads dont risk more than equity on a single trade position size matters not leverage your position size can be as big as needed while risking only of your equity leverage needs to be determined keeping the stop loss in mind dont risk more than on one trade this concludes part of risk management optimum position sizing it might be boring but is the most important part of trading read it several times next part of risk management to release soon please share the thread to help a fellow trader love emperorbtc follow emperorbtc risk management part part entering the trade entering a trade without ascertaining a certain thing is gambling in this masterclass we will learn the prerequisites to enter a trade dont enter a trade without determinng the following please share we understand what reward to risk popularly called risk to reward is it will be denoted by rr we will also try to bust a few myths about rr and how to avoid losing trades before entering a trade you need to determine things entry trigger stop loss target entry trigger reasons for entering a trade there could be multiple reasons or a single reason for entry generally a set of reasons aka confluence is a higher probability trade and a generally a safer entry follow emperorbtc example of an entry trigger stop loss the price in the opposite direction of the trade where the trade is exited at a loss at this level the reason for the entry becomes invalidated according to ta and the price can then move in the opposite direction probabilistically follow emperorbtc target is the possible price level that the asset might touch based on previous trends or confluence and where a possible reversal could occur target is the next path of least resistance from where the price might reverse we will always only use ta to determine all a combination of the three coming together forms rr we will try to understand what really rr in this thread rr simply is the ratio of the distance between entry and target and entry and the stop loss here is an example of the rr ratio follow emperorbtc rr is generally denoted in ratio form such as or if the target is above the entry and the stop loss is below the entry the rr is you should not be entering a trade unless the rr is known myth a fixed minimum rr is necessary for taking a trade even murphy in his book has advocated for the same but in my opinion it is a wrong benchmark to have sticking to a fixed rr can prevent us from entering a high probability trade at times eg at confluences so what is the right way to use rr and how do traders with low win rate turn out to be profitable profitability depends on factors rr and win rate follow emperorbtc study the chart below the above chart describes how much rr is needed for a certain level of win rate eg if your win rate is you will be at breakeven at a rr ratio of the formula to calculate the same is as below follow emperorbtc the above might seem confusing but the crux of the matter is test your strategy find your win rate use only the rr setups which suits your win rate eg always choose a trade with rr greater than if win rate is around conclusion find your win rate choose trades with rr which suits your win rate base the above only on ta never enter a trade without knowing the target and sl dont get stuck with a fixed rr the completes the risk to reward tutorial it is a must use to tool to avoid trades that dont suit our win rate this gives a huge trading edge as most of the lower win probability trades can be avoided we will learn stop loss placement next please share if this was useful follow emperorbtc stop loss masterclass on stop loss of the traders fail because they dont understand stop loss stop loss is the most important topic to prevent liquidation and avoiding bankruptcy this is all you need to master stop loss there are only tools in trading which will prevent you from blowing up your account risk management stop loss if you dont follow the rules of the above you will fail period in this thread we will master stoploss in detail follow emperorbtc different charts different sl a common fallacy amongst traders is that stop loss has to be a certain fixed percent of loss eg fixing stop loss at this is a very bad idea stop loss should be based on ta alone every setup is different and a fixed sl wont work stop loss invalidation level entry is made only as per ta on a valid reason for a directional move once the reason for the entry has been lost the trade must be exited the event at which the reason for entry ceases to exist is the invalidation level entry example invalidation point reached get out stop loss is a tool to be absolutely used as soon as the setup reaches an invalidation point always establish the invalidation point before entering a trade as soon as the invalidation event turns true exit without a second thought follow emperorbtc once the reason for the entry has been lost exit the trade as the premise for the entry no longer exists if the entry was made because of a support being confirmed but if the support gets broken the reason for the entry no longer exists and hence a stop loss must be entered let us understand placing the stop loss with the help of few examples i will only be using simple supportresistance reasons for entry to keep it simple placing sl during consolidation breakout note i place it a little below the invalidation level to prevent stop hunts follow emperorbtc placing stop loss with supply demand zone recognition breakout retest confirmation supply zone flip breakout confirmation lets try to understand a bit advanced stop loss using obv volume price goes up volume doesnt price goes down volume goes up this is bearish price goes up obv doesnt support is broken bullish invalidation sl entered follow emperorbtc note this is how top was confirmed stop loss is a very controversial topic as some traders dont like to place a sl order as it could lead to stop loss hunting some traders swear by a strict stop loss order being placed as soon as an entry is placed the solution to this dilemma is discussed below place the sl below the invalidation point to avoid sl hunting by wicks exit the trade on invalidation with using sl manually after the invalidation is confirmed to avoid stop loss hunting i personally exit manually after invalidation is confirmed to prevent sl hunting follow emperorbtc we will learn more about stop hunting in the next thread conclusion stop loss cannot be a fixed percentage as all trade setups are different stop loss is nothing but an exit at an invalidation level reason for entry no longer valid stop loss use only ta to find stop loss stop loss invalidation level always have the stop loss determined before entering a trade you dont have to post the sl order you can exit manually on invalidation to avoid false wicks aka stop hunting ps dont be in a rush to move your sl to breakeven this leads to your market participation without any benefit we will learn about this concept part of trading bitcoin masterclass read the thread again practise it with support resistance and place sl at invalidation every setup needs its unique sl read the charts adapt to different setups practice practice practice hope this helps share if you found it useful to help other traders follow emperorbtc volume part masterclass on volume for trading bitcoin this is module to the most comprehensive realworld guide to volume analysis volume is a simple yet most powerful tool this is everything that you need to master it please retweet so many more can see it and benefit price and volume are the only parameters you need to trade successfully all indicators and tools in existence are derived from the above we will complete the volume study in modules in this thread we will cover the module consisting of the following topics meaning volume average what is highlow volume why is volume importantsmart money volume trends and reversals entry at supportresistance conclusion what is volume it refers to the amount of asset traded over a fixed time purchase and sale of unit is regarded as volume of unit and not follow emperorbtc eg if the volume of on binance for btc is million usd it means theres been a purchase and sale of million usd worth of btc the table below explains how cumulative volume is calculated follow emperorbtc many authors themselves get the concept of total volume wrong eg below is an extract from a forex trading tutorial where the concept of total volume is incorrectly explained on its own the volume has no use eg its of no use to know that the volume of bitcoin in the last hours was billion usd however when combined with previous volumes and price action its helpful in taking a trade this is explained below what does low volume and high volume mean lowhigh volume and lowhigh liquidity is a different concept when we talk about lowhigh volume were taking in a relative term a low volume refers to a volume lower than the average volume and vice versa for high volume follow emperorbtc what does average volume mean it refers to the moving average of the volume calculated on the basis of previous sessions the average could be of any time period the default average on tv is i use here is how you can viewchange it so why is volume study important an increase in volume denotes an increase in interest and buyingselling by holders of big funds institutions aka smart money smart money are the holders of higher capital and more information its generally believed that smart money has access to better analysis and more info hence the levels that see the higher volume is regarded as an area of interest smart money moves in to buysell at a certain level increasing the volume substantially a lower level of volume sees buyssells only from the retail investors with little capital showcasing a period of weak hands buying and a time of uncertainty follow emperorbtc conclusion higher volume smart money with more info and funds buying hence its an area of interest effects of volume the effects of volume on price can be understood with the help of the following cheat sheet we will discuss all situations in detail we will also study where we can enter a trade and increase our positions after we have discussed all the scenarios price increases with increasing volume the volume here acts as a support to the uptrend this kind of uptrend is said to be confirmed by volume follow emperorbtc in the chart below see how in an uptrend the volume too incrementally increasing confirming an uptrend with volume expansion price increases with decreasing volume see the chart below following a downtrend there is a slight uptrend many traders would assume this to be a reversal however this is accompanied by decreasing volume this proves it to be just a correction and not reversal hence increase in price with a decrease in volume points towards an uptrend not supported by volume it isnt safe to long this uptrend this kind of price volume movement denotes a correction in a downtrend rather than a reversal follow emperorbtc price decreases with increasing volume when price decreases with increasing volume the volume here confirms the downtrend the chart below denotes a short entry and an addition to position upon further break of support this is a multiconfirmation entry when the sudden increase in volume leads to a downtrend and the support zone is broken this leads to a high volume as well as high momentum entry high momentum short previous support broken also see how the position is increased upon breaking of a further support price decreases with decreasing volume this decrease in price is not confirmed by volume and hence can be regarded as a correction in uptrend and not confirmation notice how the volume decreases upon downtrend and hence this isnt a reversal for a short entry follow emperorbtc the bull market of saw an ath of however the ath was not accompanied with equally high volume notice how the volume at ath is lower than the average volume the volume at ath is equal to what it was at levels it was a warning for many for the upcoming dump trade entries at support a support is confirmed with a volume expansion a long entry can be taken here which is generally a high probability trade to be more sure you can enter upon breakout from a local swing high as in this case follow emperorbtc long entry at resistance is showcased below notice how there is a sudden volume expansion at the resistance which the volume rising substantially above the average volume here we enter after volume expansion and retest for a high probability trade the short entries can be entered in the similar fashion it has also been illustrated in case no hence increase in volume confirms the trend direction of the trend it is important to relate the volume to the average volume end of module most of my successful trades were based only on volume analysis there will be total modules we will discuss volume divergences obv pattern volume breakouts volume profile market profile in the upcoming modules all the best study it many times follow emperorbtc bullish divergence masterclass on divergence part get ready to master the most profitable tool in trading for predicting the tops and the bottoms a bit complicated but if you read this thread you will master it completely for scalping and swing trades share it all new traders need it part aim to help traders identity divergence and learn entry triggers most traders can identity a divergence but dont know how to use it to time the entry we will try to master the entry in this thread all realworld trades taken because of divergences have been shown below when price moves in a certain direction the momentum oscillator too should move in the same direction and manner eg when price makes a higher high the momentum oscillator too should make a higher high this is called convergence see example below follow emperorbtc in a rare occurrence the momentum oscillator and the price dont follow a similar path this phenomenon is called divergence it occurs because the average change in the lookback period the time period of the oscillator is in a different direction as compared to the price divergences are used to find a potential reversal on the larger time frame or a swingscalp opportunity on the lower time frame a minimum of hour time frame is preferred since they may fail very rarely it is better to accompany the entry with further confirmations important points we will cover rsi divergences macd and obv will be covered after a masterclass on those indicators coming soon prices in this thread refer to the lows only the closing value is chosen for studying divergences since the source for rsi is the closing value bullish divergence marketstructure it is formed when the downtrend price move is going to reverse the lows of the price and oscillator are not in sync useful in predicting the bottom to find bullish divergences always look at the lows of the oscillator and the price follow emperorbtc tips dont look for divergences in a nontrending market there must be clear new levels ie higher high higher lows or lower highs and lower lows formed divergences are very reliable adding further price movement confirmations leads to a more profitable setup strong bullish divergence the price makes a lower low but the oscillator makes a higher low this means although the price is decreasing the overall average rate of change in the chosen period is increasing ie the sellers are not selling at the same momentum entry using the same chart above the concept of supply absorption candle momentum confirmation supply zone retest adding position on retest confirmation is illustrated in this trade all these have been used in sync with divergence for a high probability entry follow emperorbtc medium bullish divergence the price makes a double bottom same level as earlier low and the oscillator makes a higher low this means that at the same price levels the momentum is increasing illustration with a trade example presented below follow emperorbtc weak bullish divergence the price makes a lower low but the oscillator has the same low levels double bottom this means even though the price is decreasing the momentum is intact illustration of weak divergence presented below follow emperorbtc trade using the same setup this was one of the most beautiful trades i have ever taken pure price movement explained in the chart confirmation of bullish divergence bullish candle confirmation entry channel breakout capital addition upon retest exit upon sr break here is another trade that was taken based on a weak bullish divergence with candlestick confirmations divergence confirmed supply absorbing candle appears doji in a downtrend bullish kicker entry made above candle in point follow emperorbtc hidden bullish divergence i dont trade it in a weird manner the price increases the momentum oscillator value decreases this signifies that even at a reducing momentum there is enough buying interest to push the price up explained with a trade setup below this completes the part of divergence masterclass remember for bullish divergence only look at the lows read it several times it will change your trading game will release part soon bearish divergences please share it to help a fellow trader love emperorbtc follow emperorbtc bearish divergence masterclass on divergence part this is the final part of the divergence masterclass we will cover bearish scenarios and shorting lets go note we only look at the value of the body of the candle and not the wicks bearish divergence only looks at the highs remember bearish divergence is used to find the tops so look at the highs only strong bearish divergence the price makes a higher high but the oscillator makes a lower high this means that even though the price is moving higher the average momentum of the look back period is decreasing this is a potential top signal trade here is the shame chart explaining the short entry using short confirmation sr break ema support exit on support break take the time to study it follow emperorbtc here is another setup i used which luckily caught the exact top giving a short movement notice the volume expansion medium bearish divergence here the price makes a double top but the oscillator makes a lower high this means that at the same price level the momentum has decreased this is one of my personal favorite setups trade setup using the same chart a bearish entry is explained when the support line breaks notice the use of bearish engulfing retracement volume follow emperorbtc weak bearish divergence the price makes a higher high but the oscillator makes a double top this means that the average momentum isnt ready to go up even as the price goes up simple confirmation breakdown setup explained below follow emperorbtc hidden bearish divergence the price makes a lower high but the oscillator makes a higher high this means that the price is going down even after theres an increase in the average momentum in the lookback period trade setup this setup although did not catch the absolute top but provided a highprofit short entry notice how the accumulation zone break is used as a short trigger this completes the last part of the divergence masterclass for rsi we will cover macd and obv in near future threads this is a very powerful and profitable concept read several times master it all the best follow emperorbtc open interest masterclass on open interest oi is the most important tool for leverage trading its the best tool to judge longshort sentiment true volume strength market structure true liquidity shift in trend please share it every trader needs it this is all you need open interest is the metric that tells you the number of open derivatives contracts futures or options each contract has sides buyer and the seller or longs and shorts the number of openactive trade contracts is called open interest people often confuse volume and oi while they are related they arent the same volume talks about the number of contracts traded during a day buy sell contract volume open interest is explained below follow emperorbtc oi talks about open contracts ie open positions each contract has sides a buying long and a selling short side hence in one trade a buyer goes long and the seller goes short this forms one contract and not two this one contract is denoted as open interest oi calculation its not difficult and you can understand it very easily with some patience traders a b c are in the market a and b think the price will go up and enter a long of contracts each c thinks the price will go down and enter a short of contracts follow emperorbtc in the above case a and b have entered longs together and c has entered shorts the total contracts open in the market are and hence the open interest is on day a decides to add longs b decides to close longs c does nothing the total open contracts remain the same conclusion oi doesnt change when contacts are transferred it changes only when newer contracts are created amongst the participants or be new players day d a new trader enters the market with short entries a increases his long entry by total open contracts conclusion new open interest is created when new contracts are created either through new traders or through new market participants follow emperorbtc key takeaways from the calculation oi means open contractspositions there has to be a long for every short hence derivatives trading is often called a zerosum game oi will increase only when new contracts are created in the market like volume explained in the chart below oi has no use on its own its just data however when studied along with price it becomes one of the most important tools for leverage trading ever i always use oi data for swing trading explained below follow emperorbtc open interest like price is continuous data the new contracts opened are added to the existing oi and that becomes the new oi value volume on the other hand is calculated per day and is not continuous let us now understand the different scenarios in open interest and how to use them long buildup long covering unwinding short buildup short covering unwinding long buildup price goes up oi goes up a scenario where the price of the asset and the oi increases simultaneously is called a long build up here the market participants are entering into new contracts and the long sentiment is stronger pushing the prices higher follow emperorbtc long coveringunwinding price down oi decrease in this scenario the oi and the price both decrease this happens because long previously entered are taking profits ie contracts are being closed reducing the oi follow emperorbtc this is also a declaration of larger traders covering closing their longs since they feel the target has been reached or the trend has reversed this mostly occurs after the price has seen a substantial rise see the chart above and is looking for a retracement or a reversal short buildup price down oi up in this scenario the price goes down with the oi increasing the sentiment to open up a short trade is stronger new contracts are being formed and hence the oi is increasing short entry scenario explained follow emperorbtc short covering unwinding price up oi down here the price increases with the oi decreasing this means that the people who had entered into a short position are closing their entries this generally occurs after the price has made a substantial correction the open interest data when studied with price movement becomes a very strong indicator to be used with price action trading below we will understand two setups for different scenarios long and a short entry please take the time to study them in detail short buildup explained in chart short build up support break retest of support invalidation short entry with oi confirmation position addition exit with supply absorbing candle follow emperorbtc long buildup explained in chart long build resistance break volume expansion oi confirmation study this in detail how oi confirms a long using oi follow emperorbtc lets look at price movement and how its indicated by oi here we see a clear short buildup where price decreases while oi increases when the target for a short entry is achieved the bigger players exit their contracts leading to a reduction in oi and relief bounce avoiding false reversals reversal points are used to enter a swing trade however many traders get trapped in a false reversal follow emperorbtc here is an example to a voice a false reversal using oi open interest is the most important day trading tool many traders dont understand it enough this thread is all you need read it multiple times practice it on live charts share and leave a like if this was helpful will continue to make more detailed threads emperorbtc follow emperorbtc head and shoulders masterclass on head shoulders pattern for trading bitcoin comprehensive guide to head and shoulders pattern made exhaustive enough for trading purposes t’s a frequently occurring misunderstood and arguably the most useful pattern rt would be appreciated hs is probably the first pattern a trader hears of here is what we will cover content nature identification occurrence historical performance finding entries high probability trades stop losses miscellaneous conclusion follow emperorbtc nature the head and shoulders top is a reversal bearish pattern signifying a prospective drop in future prices the formation of pattern with a breakdown from its necklinebase starts a probable bearish move identification a prospective hs pattern should have distinct peaks the middle peak is the head this is the highest point of this pattern sitting in between shorter peaks ie the shoulders there must be an overlap in prices of these distinct peaks the line where these prices overlap is called the neckline a head and shoulders pattern is easily visible so don’t force yourself into finding it the more times the prices overlap the stronger is the pattern note look for symmetry in the shoulders a high time frame high range pattern where the head is not higher than times the shoulder range has higher chances of success follow emperorbtc volume the consensus is that the left shoulder should have the highest volume the head lesser and the right shoulder the least this isnt a rule but a general observation it could change often note in my experience low volume during breakout could hint toward a back test soon a high volume breakdown might not see a retest immediately occurrence the pattern generally occurs after a substantial rise in price ie it occurs when a price has significantly risen and is looking for a reversal john murphy was of the opinion that the neckline is likely to be an upward trending follow emperorbtc however it can occur in a horizontal and less likely in a downward sloping line here is an example of downward sloping hs historical performance hs is probably the best performing pattern in both bull and bear markets although the success rate of meeting the target calculated by range of the depth is only a little more than the rise is good enough to make ample profit the pattern has a low rate of failure the patterns which fail after breaking the neckline give enough upside to exit at breakeven a breakout is generally followed by a throwback to the neckline levels in a trending market here we see a target being met and the price falling further before a throwback throwback means the return of price to the neckline levels follow emperorbtc finding entries the entry should be taken only when the pattern is completed not in an anticipation of a completion example of an anticipated pattern failure the entry is made once the neckline breaks to the downside see the example below wait for the pattern to completely form wait for the breach of the neckline enter only if the above events occur high probability entries and failure the head and shoulders pattern could fail at times here is an example of a failed pattern the failure generally occurs when the volume showcases an anomaly or the market structure is looking only for a consolidation and not retracement follow emperorbtc to avoid the above as much as possible a high probability entry can be entered in the following manners waiting for a retest high volume breakout high momentum breakout discussed below retest of the neckline it is common for the breakdown from the head and shoulders pattern to go back up and test the neckline an establishment of resistance at the neckline is a high probability entry for shorting wait for the retest in case of a low volume low momentum breakout after the retest wait for a bounce from the neckline and then enter follow emperorbtc sometimes the neckline does not get retested in this case if the breakdown is accompanied by high momentum or high volume a safe entry is available here is an example of highvolume breakdown without a retestthat was a safe entry high momentum breakdown if the breakdown is such along with breaking the neckline a previous support is also broken then a short entry can be taken without a retest after the support is broken follow emperorbtc finding targets a common practice is to target the same number of points as is the range of the head many people have different opinion on measuring the range i follow a conservative method to measure from the neckline to the lowest point of the topmost candle stop losses a method used by peter brandt is placing the stop loss above the high of the candle just before the breakout in my opinion this works well however id place it a bit higher considering the volatility of bitcoin illustration below follow emperorbtc study this in deatail complete market structure of hs price is in an uptrend price looks for a reversal forming head and shoulders neck line breaks down followed back a retest of the neckline price declines again at a range equal to the range of the head price then gets a throwback up to the neckline the resistance at the neckline is broken followed by a retest of the neckline and continuation to the upside trade example with entry and stop loss same general strategy can be followed for the different high probability methods mentioned above follow emperorbtc miscellaneous sometimes the market structure see a hs inside a hs the price movement for this structure is exactly the same we might also come across this pattern with or more shoulders on the either side the effect on price remains the same follow emperorbtc conclusion head and shoulders is a powerful pattern with high probability of success wait for a confirmation dont anticipate the pattern look closely at the volume during a breakdown read the above thread a few times and you will always have this pattern at your disposal i hope this was useful if you dont understand a point or find it difficult give it a go once more like everything else it gets easier upon practice and repetition follow emperorbtc price action trading masterclass on price action trading an indepth and detailed series on pa trading by the end of this series you will master price action trading chapter price market psychology study this thread will introduce the fundamental block of pa price market psychology how the market perceives the impact of news to influence the price is called price market psychology we will be learning how murphy fring and others give importance only to price and nothing else according to pa price contains all the information needed to make a decision and hence no other analysis is necessary follow emperorbtc price market psychology prices are determined by peoples perception of changing fundamentals the strength of a fundamental is limited to how much impact itll have on peoples psychology about the asset price explanation the price of a freely traded asset is not determined by the news but by the perception of the people about the impact of such news if the news can change the psychology of the market about an asset only then will the price change assets are worth what people think they are worth the psychology leads to multiple perpetual conclusions from one participant to another and hence a trend is formed a price trend because the psychology of a market is overall the same and changes over time in a trend explanation the value of the asset is what people think its worth and the psychology of an assets worth makes the trend this is why asset prices are not randomly scattered on a chart but in a trend an increase in earnings or market growth or technical advancements by a companyasset doesnt determine the trend of the price only the perception of the market towards these changes determines the price more earning doesnt mean higher prices explanation it doesnt matter if the revenue or earnings of a company is increasing or their technology is advancing the price of an asset only depends upon the perception of the people ie market psychology about an asset follow emperorbtc examples below the price of mcdonalds stock continued to decrease throughout the at this time mcdonalds was booming an increase in earnings mass expansion of franchises still the prices decreased this means the market didnt factor the revenues growth to be enough stimulus the price of amazon took years to come back to where it was in do you think in the time period amazon was less technologically advanced than in no its just that the market perception about amazon in was a lot higher than in the later years follow emperorbtc action not just price prices do not act as support or resistance the structure and the path taken to reach there makes them a sr for example if a resistance is broken with low momentum and low volume its likely that its not completely broken the longer the time period or the duration of the chart the better performance of the chart patterns the reason why longerterm trends have a habit of being slightly more reliable is that they are less subject to random noise and manipulation the notion that the upwards movement of the price is because there are more buyers than sellers is not true for any transaction to happen there should be equal numbers of buyers and sellers the difference here is enthusiasm what truly is happens is the enthusiasm of the buyers is more than the sellers for the price to move up there is more psychological enthusiasm to buy than to sell this completes the price market psychology i have skipped the history as its not much relevant this will help you understand how price is the king and thats all you need to study this series will be better than anything on the market stay tuned chapter complete follow emperorbtc altcoin breakout altcoin breakout study in detail breakout pattern accumulation breakout with volume ema bullish crossover breakout confirmed with a retest support established with ema and accumulation resistance exit i had shared a pdf about trading altcoins on telegram i showed my neo trade back in i will be taking the same example here to identify a breakout entry exit using the bitcoin cycle altcoins follow bitcoin price cycle explained earlier one of the most common breakout patterns on most altcoins is cup and handle the name isnt important its basically a smooth bottoming with another retracement thats smaller this is followed by either accumulation or any other bullish pattern follow emperorbtc after the cup and handle formation a period of consolidation occurred very common we could only guess if it was a bullish consolidation or not at that time we will discuss below how a guess could have been made about it being an accumulation during accumulation the average volume rises for the first time on a bearish candle however in this instance the movement when studied with volume closely isnt bearish in nature this is explained in the chart follow emperorbtc this is clearly followed by the volume expansion continuing the price rise to the resistance and volume continuing about the average volume ive explained previously how the more times resistance is tested the weaker it becomes a clean volume breakout with volume expansion and follow through accumulation confirmed study the chart below follow emperorbtc this is the interesting part as for most accumulations we see retest sr flip previous resistance becomes support ema now acting as a support front running the trend perfect entry is made when emas crossover had been bullish accumulation confirmed retest and sr flip ema acting as support follow emperorbtc this was a lucky catch with a bit of skill and a lot of luck as described in the pdf the rr here was massive i was lucky to be in the right place and at the right time many people bought it at a lot lower and sold much higher as described altcoins follow btc the chart of btc perfectly matches neo or any other alt with a delay one could easily study the bitcoin cycle and predict the top on alts as seen here

traders fail trading has no barriers or minimum qualification of entry unlike being a doctor engineer etc most traders start without learning or reading hence they fail imagine flying a without training for it disaster will ensue same for trading the true test of a trader starts in an uncertain market as a trader your aim is to make profit in all kinds of market ranging bullish bearish trends last for months as a trader you should be able to make money by being long or short this is what were supposed to learn you should be equally comfortable going long and going short you need a predefined backtested system if you dont have this you shouldnt even think about trading period predefined your system tells you when to enter backtested tested for historical profitability long term holdings dont hold anything thats below the day moving average this implies a fundamental flaw or a cyclic correction at this point no one knows where the bottom is dont try to be a hero cut your losses take a walk and come back later enter the trend always find the trend on the higher timeframe eg weekly and then confirm it in lower time frame daily and hourly and enter is the same direction dont try to counter trade remember find trend on higher time frame confirm on lower and only then enter the reason traders fail is because most are too lazy to backtest improve upon mistakes sit with live charts draw your supports area of interest enter the trade and see the results live do it as much as you can over an over again trade more learn more follow emperorbtc make a trading journal

threads follow emperorbtc learn basic ta on your own learn trading from scratch for extreme beginners compiled by emperorbtc chart plotting method candlesticks technical analysis starts and ends with candlesticks they are the building blocks of ta there are many forms of graphs like bars heikin ashi renko point and figure but for me candlesticks has worked the best you can find a link to a very basic introduction to candlesticks here start with mastering doji there are about types of doji engulfing patterns hammer marubozu shooting star hanging man tweezers best book that i recommend for leading candlesticks is encyclopedia by thomas bulkowski dont read it in one go study it slowly lines there are types of support and resistances demand and supply zones trend lines horizontal lines demand and supply zone is the area where the liquidity is formed here is a tutorial on how to use candlesticks are a method to find demand and supply i will be posting more tutorial on the same see chapter introduction to technical analysis trend lines are nonhorizontal support and resistance lines they are useful for day trading and giving powerful entries you can find a brief introduction about it here i will be posting a detailed tutorial on trendlines very soon horizontal lines are one of the most important levels on all time frames ive already done a tutorial on them see chapter support and resistance follow emperorbtc if need be you can refer technical analysis and stock market profits by richard schabacker as reference for support and resistance moving averages there are mostly used moving averages simple moving average or exponential moving average there are many traders who claim to have invented a secret moving average strategy i dont think moving averages can work as a buysell indicator rather they help us recognize a trend dont ever make buying or selling decision based on moving averages strategy eg triple ma crossover strategy or crossover strategy they dont work in the long run use them as a trend indicator and for confirmations you can use the moving average feature on trading view and see how they work as support and resistance there are many built in indicator like the indicator to work around with chart patterns the best book for studying chart pattern is the encyclopedia by thomas bulkowski however john murphy had also discussed it in brief in his book i have done a tutorial on the most common chart pattern head and shoulders here see chapter head and shoulders you should start with studying triangles flags pennants cup and handles adam and eve and master them few tools to add to your support and resistance arsenal are fibonacci retracements channels and consolidation zones use these to find support and resistance and not as an independent tool themselves you can enhance your support and resistance zones using ichimoku clouds a bit convoluted for beginners but is a good tool i will be providing my bitcoin settings for ichimoku in future the above topics are more than enough to get you started there are advanced took that i used like open interest volume profile funding rates however i suggest mastering the above topics and only then move to such topics take it slow build a strong foundation follow emperorbtc volume cheat sheet simple volume deductions memorize and understand the logic behind it follow emperorbtc how pump and dump works how pump and dump works a guide this is a real example from january when influencers on twitter decided to pump and dump on their followers note these coins are low liquid assets with daily volume lower than throwing in btc does the job to pump stay safe follow emperorbtc prerequisites to trading things to do before you start trading bitcoin ive been trading bitcoin full time since seen a lot of traders burn their face here are things you should do before you start trading btc before you even consider taking up trading bitcoin consider the following of you will lose all your capital because of lack of knowledge youre fighting against the greatest minds the sharpest instincts who have decades of experience trading the traditional market you need a predefined backtested and multi scenario system if you dont have this you shouldnt even think about trading period predefined your system tells you when to enter you wait for an entry you know when to exit this is predefined you dont enter anytime else backtested traditional market traders backtest for at least a decade btc traders for the lack of data at least need to backrest for years anything else is unacceptable at best only if your system consistently gives a high probability entry its worth considering paper trading once your strategy has been backtested you need to paper trader at least for a month make paper entries in the live market there isnt enough skin in the game but this gives your realworld live insight into your system once the above has been done you can move on to trading but trading only spot market spot market doesnt offer any leverage which is a blessing for new traders follow emperorbtc try this for a month only if you get successful in the spot market think about moving to leveraged trading the above steps take time patience follow it for a stable but solid foundation before you enter leveraged trading follow emperorbtc recommended books best books to learn trading this is a personal opinion technical analysis and stock market profits by schabacker a difficult read but overall solid foundation technical analysis of the financial market by murphy an easy read for most beginners candlestick and chart pattern encyclopedia by thomas bulkowski a difficult read if you try to finish it in one go take it slow and use it as a reference market wizard series by schwager interesting insights technical analysis and stock trends edwards and magee some might find it a dull books but it is valuable trading price action trends by al brooks would be interesting for those who only rely on indicators there could obviously be better books but im just sharing the ones i liked out of many cheers follow emperorbtc my best trading lessons best trading advice after a decade of trading i have been a fulltime trader for about years now first years were spent in blowing up my account several times here are the best lessons i can share with you please sharert if you find this useful you shouldnt be trading if you dont have a system which has been back tested for at least a few years worth of data or as long as the asset has existed back testing is easy and anyone can do it manually backtest it on the asset of your interest as every asset is different a lessons from jack schwager that stuck with me your system should have an edge period relying only on money management wont work you need an asymmetric bet a low probability system wont work in the long run even with godly money management eg can you consistently win at russian roulette with good money management the answer is obviously no gambling is a low portability bet money management cant earn you consistently with a low probability system your system needs an edge a probability of lot more than follow emperorbtc there is no room for hardwork in trading explanation trading should be calm simple and a waiting game your system should tell you the entry and exit you should not be breaking a sweat if your system isnt there yet dont trade you need hardwork to learn discover improve your system and read new things use hardwork to practice train and improvise the actual act of performance should be easy all of the above is easy patience to execute and wait for an entry is difficult your system wont work all the time and one failure will make your distrust it stick to your system if your system had been backtested papertraded stick to it there is no single system that works build a one that works for you and works good enough check list for entering a trade your system should clearly give an entry you have a predetermined reason for exit all possible support resistances should be clearly known if the above things arent in place dont enter a trade ever any other entry is probably a gamble before you start trading paper trade the live market for a few months there is no rush you are not losing out on anything before you start day trading trade spot for at least a month it gets you used to the system and the volatility without the evils of leverage follow emperorbtc if youre leverage trading a stop loss is a must have a look at this chary from november no one expected this kind of range several of my friends who got in the crypto bull run bus were liquidated no stop loss is a quick passage to liquidation most difficult but important lesson try learning the art not the recipe most new traders want to learn a method a trick or a strategy this wont ever work in the long run as the market changes i cant tell you how many times ive to tweak my system because of fluctuations in market cycle and volatility eg at the cost of being trolled i remember a scene from breaking bad gus fring is going to kill pinkman and ww victor has been watching them cook and can take over ww reminds victor that he wont be able to cook if follow emperorbtc the outside temperature changes when the moisture is higher when the chemical proprieties change due to temperature this saved them pinkman and ww conclusion learn to study the price movement thoroughly from the basics give it time to build a solid foundation all indicators except volume related are derived from price a study of price movement is superior to anything else be fluid with your bias legends like peter brandt are trolled for changing their opinions and bias very often strong price opinions have no place in trading you need to learn that trends change very often there is no shame in changing from a bullish bias to a bearish one if the charts say so have strong principles loose opinions eg today itself i felt like btc could breakdown to but as time progressed i made a long entry at fluidity in bias brings you frequent opportunities dont ever hold onto a losing trade if there are no signs of reversal hopes and prayers dont work in trading get out of a losing trade asap market will give you enough opportunities change with the trend follow emperorbtc i have never been able to catch the top and the bottom and have no interest nor the ability to do so most amount of money is made during the movement between the top and the bottom waiting for confirmations and taking lower profits will yield better result always wait for multilevel confirmations to enter a trade and an entry on multi time frames this lowers the number of entries that you will find but increases the profit probability of your trade there were some tips i had off of my head many traders better than me could teach you something a lot better but this is what comes to my mind right now i hope this was worth your time all the best trading follow emperorbtc scalp short sample a guy with a girls pic as his profile photo messaged me and said its ridiculous that i call you all my family and advised against it i am going to take his advice and continue being ridiculous my family here is the analysis of the short entry entry exit the above chart explains the entry look how i entered after multiple confirmations exit was easy i expected the previous lows to be tested after so many short confirmations and placed my bids there the short went till range but i had my orders at itself could have been a lot more profit but wasnt looking to catch the bottom follow emperorbtc long swing sample analysis of the trade executed today without typos this time entry exit i was already in another trade when the presented ascending triangle was forming basically its a pattern where the resistance keeps getting tested and new higher lows are formed constantly notice how the chart above the volume increased as soon as we bounced off the upward trending trendline forming a new higher low this could be taken as a probable upward move incoming after closing the then existing trade shares in twitter earlier a new entry was made at levels multiple confirmations taken into consideration to enter the trade mentioned in the chart follow emperorbtc after the entry there was a concern if the ongoing uptrend was a temporary pump the price showed many retracements consolidation lowering of momentum at the resistance and retests this led to a belief of the uptrend being organic and not a temporary pump i tweeted yesterday that we need to keep a close eye on these levels the price action then taking place mimicked the sudden dump that took place on may however we didnt exist for the following reasons mentioned in the chart a true test of patience it certainly was follow emperorbtc the exit was taken at levels multiple confirmations for exit have been mentioned in the chart obviously now we know it wasnt a perfect exist but i followed my system p s the fake ascending triangle breakout will be explained in a tutorial on triangles in future this might be a tough and timeconsuming read there are a few new terms you might have to google a little bit eventually you will get it upon repeated reading all the best shared on twitter earlier thats what i meant cant escape the typo it seems follow emperorbtc day trading strategy crypto daytrading secret strategy simple high profit no nonsense one of the best strategies for scalping crypto share it to help all beginners we will use three basic indicators pivot points vwap stoch rsi note this strategy will have a much higher probability of success if basic price action volume and candlestick pattern is kept in mind use the strategy i will introduce the tools and then explain the strategy i will talk about the calculations to arrive at the indicators separately important dont use the indicators alone eg stoch rsi has less than hit rate so you cant use it alone to trade tool pivot points they are reversal points based the historical prices go to the indicators tab and type pivot point standard the settings to be used have been disclosed in the pic below note you can choose your own settings but i have disclosed the ones i use follow emperorbtc follow emperorbtc this is what they will look like ignore all notations and just remember all the lines are support or resistance lines lines of interest it doesnt matter if its been denoted as pr or s we will learn how to use them below practically you can also use the custom indicator for pivot point by hpotter the settings for this indicator are already tweaked by the author note i dont know the author hence not able to provide credit follow emperorbtc tool vwap volume weighted average price indicates an overall trend of the market by including volume in the average prices sometimes it filters out fakeouts with low volumes hence being a powerful indicator we are looking for a vwap cross note on vwap it cannot be used on its own it works best on time frame lower than hours i have highlighted my vwap settings below follow emperorbtc tool stoch rsi it is comprised of lines k the faster line blue line in example d the slower line red line in example when the blue line goes above the red line its a bullish crossover note we will not deal with the concept of overbought and over sold here conditions for long entry the tools mentioned should give the following signal • bullish stoch rsi crossover • vwap break to the upside • pivot point support established or resistance break the sequence of signals doesnt matter note exact opposite for shorting follow emperorbtc • strategy works best for scalping • can be combined with volume expansion • occurrence of candlestick pattern increases probability only enter after all three of the above have taken place entry to be made on candle confirmation next candle above the current candle understanding of price actions and practice over time will make this the most successful and addictive strategy here is an example of pivot points acting as support and as resistance on the next target follow emperorbtc using basic knowledge of volume candlestick patterns confirmations will lead to a higher probability entry note it will reduce the amount of entry but increase the profitability ration example follow emperorbtc conclusion • use the strategy for daytrading •dont use the indicators alone •wait for all the signals • this is not a perfect strategy it will fail follow risk management always combining it with pa volume will give magical results so this is my secret and now its yours i enter into many scalp entries but dont share much because •its too fast •needs constant management •is risky if done without risk management try is on live charts and please share it a lot love you guys i need to sleep now follow emperorbtc altcoin swing strategy altcoin

history no volume bots follow emperorbtc to trade or to hold if youre going to trade i have made a lot of strategies already if youre looking to hold we will discuss when to enter for holding when to enter after fa as mentioned in the above we begin to find the entry i use only charts to find the entry jack d schwager has mentioned many times how he only uses ta to find entry for his investments we discussed in detail in introduction to ta how chart is all you need strategy for hodl entry ema cross volume around the cross ema squeeze before the cross enter on breakout candle crossing the high of previous candle volume must increase after ema cross breakout better if breakout candle is an engulfing follow emperorbtc i am sharing the settings for the ema here time frame daily chart the cross we are looking for a bullish cross of the and the ema these are my personal settings and can be tweaked by anyone but this is what i use the red has to be above green and so forth with blue and black follow emperorbtc candles hidden for clarity volume this doesnt always occur because very few people use this technique but while the whales accumulate you can see a little increase in volume if a clear volume change occurs it means the breakout has a higher probability illustrated below follow emperorbtc the squeeze it means the mas coming closer illustrating an accumulation this can suggest a change in trend in either direction if the volume is increasing during squeeze it is most likes bullish the volume also must carry through after the breakout the entry this is where true edge comes in play the entry edge can only be gained with experience failure and a lot of trying here are two entry options below the risky entry is when the candle next to the engulfing cross the engulfing candles high follow emperorbtc here is an example of how it works please note use volume for entry use pa for confirmation this is not fool proof but gets better with experience the exit has been done as one of the emas turns bearish conclusion wait for ema squeeze look for volume on accumulation find cup and handle or rounding bottoms use pa for confirmation exit on bearish crossover this is my strategy of buying alts for the short terms its simple and it works i am in many alt positions right now with this tool this is for hodl i will share alt swing trading tutorial soon a request please try it on as many charts as possible and share below if you find the above setup in play on any coin kindly share it if you liked the thread it might help someone all the best follow emperorbtc altcoin cheat

on hour and daily time frame tp bearish cross share it ema used for a bullish crossover is and when ema is above ema its considered a bullish trend when cross occurs with volume expansion its even better hope the strategy is clear follow emperorbtc volume exit masterclass on volume exit when should you exit a trade determine exits using volume we will try to explore how understanding the nature of volume and price movement price increase with volume increase is bullish price increase with volume decrease is not bullish price decrease with volume increase is bearish price decrease with volume decrease is not bearish note please read the comments above carefully and have a look at the cheatsheet warning be careful with the and statement not bullish doesnt mean bearish and not bearish doesnt mean bullish hence if such a volume divergence occurs look for exit follow emperorbtc volume below average is caution if there is price expansion with volume below the average volume or if there is price contraction with volume below the average volume this should be taken as a sign of caution the price movement is happening with low market participation if the movement after entry occurs with volume below the average volume look for exit price action follows the direction of bigger market participation volume below average only retail entry higher volume bigger player entering the market follow emperorbtc volume divergence i have explained volume divergence in the examples below which is selfexplanatory if such an event occurs look for further signs of reversal for an exit follow emperorbtc trade examples support region tested several times price decreases with increasing volume entry made on new support break trivia the more a support is tested the weaker it gets the same principle can be applied to all the scenario described in the cheatsheet candle body and volume anomaly this theory was first described by david h weis look for an exit if there is uptrend increasing volume low body spread long upper wick sudden volume jump this is an anomaly in pa and should be looking for reversal follow emperorbtc read the chart retracement vs reversal sometimes people judge a normal retracement as reversal i dont suggest shorting a retracement the short below explains retracement position should be added on retracement please read the chart carefully i have explained how to use volume to judge exiting a trade you can summarise the above and try them on live charts via paper trading make such entries to master volume i hope this was useful please share it if you found it useful all the best follow emperorbtc day trading strategy with rsi day trading strategy with rsi rsi forms higher low price makes lowerlow volume decreasing on price retracement vwap broken and support established entry on resistance break note not for complete beginners time frame minute try it share it if the price goes low with a decrease in volume it means there is a probability of the sell pressure ending this same concept has been used able to find a reversal follow emperorbtc find tops in swing trading find tops in swing trading • obv divergence • decreasing volume as price increases • increasing volume as price goes down • any bearish candle and the next candle crossing its low note the short entry would be when the next candle crosses the harami low for those asking these techniques work on any market forex equity commodity crypto market changes concepts remain the same follow emperorbtc high probability altcoin entry guide high probability altcoin entry guide in this guide we will only study about the technical aspect charts to be kept in mind while taking a position in an altcoin note the best money is made in the smaller cap alts by positioning yourself on a technical price trigger entry and holding for months i don’t recommend trading small caps on a daily basis daytrading stay with major caps for day trading all the best trading altcoins i will try to share some good projects on my telegram telegram we will try to cover in brief the following topics in this tutorial breakout pattern accumulation breakout with volume ema bullish crossover breakout confirmed with a retest support established with ema and accumulation resistance exit breakout breakout means the price overcoming a resistant and is able to break free from it to make higher move here are several breakout patterns we will try to understand one here one of the most common breakout patterns on most altcoins is cup and handle the name isnt important its basically a smooth bottoming with another retracement thats smaller this is followed by either accumulation or any other bullish pattern follow emperorbtc after the cup and handle formation a period of consolidation occurred very common we could only guess if it was a bullish consolidation or not at that time we will discuss below how a guess could have been made about it being an accumulation during accumulation the average volume rises for the first time on a bearish candle however in this instance the movement when studied with volume closely isnt bearish in nature this is explained in the chart follow emperorbtc this is clearly followed by the volume expansion continuing the price rise to the resistance and volume continuing about the average volume ive explained previously how the more times resistance is tested the weaker it becomes a clean volume breakout with volume expansion and follow through accumulation confirmed study the chart below follow emperorbtc this is the interesting part as for most accumulations we see retest sr flip previous resistance becomes support ema now acting as a support front running the trend perfect entry is made when emas crossover had been bullish accumulation confirmed retest and sr flip ema acting as support illustration below follow emperorbtc entry example as described altcoins follow btc the chart of btc perfectly matches neo or any other alt with a delay one could easily study the bitcoin cycle and predict the top on alts as seen here remember the alt cycle follows btc price cycle follow emperorbtc opinion invest in projects which have a revenue positive model a public team removes the aspect of rug pulls and scams try catching the projects below million look for unique and nonplagiarized white paper the devs must be active on telegram all the best emperorbtc follow emperorbtc reversal candles masterclass on reversal candles people find it extremely difficult to exit trades and find reversals we will learn reversal candles to find change in trend exiting a trades we will discuss hammer in this thread share if you find this useful premise reversal doesnt mean a start of an opposite trend it means reevaluation or slowdown of trend dont take opposite trade on reversal signs eg if a long entry shows a reversal its not a sign to go short take an profits on reversal not opposite trade to illustrate if a reversal candle hammer in this case is formed at the bottom of a downtrend it doesnt mean a long entry must be taken reversal here means a change in change or reevaluation which should make us look for an exit and not an opposite trend follow emperorbtc hammer must occur during a downtrend the body of the candle must be at the top a long tail wick more than the body almost no or very short upper wick opinion many traders believe that confirmation isnt needed for hammer however i always look for it follow emperorbtc important hammer candle can be of either colour red or green it is still a hammer although a green hammer is more bullish but i have seen many red hammers creating a reversal illustration of hammers and chart shared with red hammer follow emperorbtc observation in my personal view tall candles longer wicks outperform short ones hammer with higher volume needs lesser confirmation hammer has a reversal rate however if the next candle closes above the high of the hammer the reversal is sure how to use hammer for trading explained in one chart downtrend reversal low volume hammer confirmation close ema break and retest position addition on ema break follow emperorbtc setup stop loss at swing low aggressive entry on volume cross average volume conservative entry on candle close above hammer exit on ema resistance confirmation i mostly wait for confirmation but traders like bloodgoodbtc tend to have an aggressive entry main summary of a hammer i have written my main point regarding a hammer keep them in mind follow emperorbtc this ends the hammer thread tip use the indicator tab on trading view to help you recognise hammer but this is no substitute for understanding it i hope it was helpful please share it if you liked the thread we will discuss new reversal candles next if you want to learn further all trading tools have been discussed in detail on my telegram from beginner to advanced level its free it works and simple for anyone to understand love you guys emperorbtc follow emperorbtc reversals price action trading masterclass chapter reversals explained in detail likert would be appreciated in this lesson we will be understand what reversal is and how to guess it i will be using pa plus some indicators to find probable reversals opinion pa traders dont really use indicators but i like to use it for some insight time period a lot of people ask me about the time period a lot of times pa can be applied to any time frame from oneminute bars to weekly and monthly charts the interpretation is identical however the only difference is that the battle between buyers and sellers is much larger on the monthly charts than on the intraday higher the time frame the better but the principles stay the same remember chart patterns perform better on higher time frames reversal explained prices dont reverse at once there is a transition period when the prices move in a horizontal manner this horizontal movement is called consolidation consolidation is likely to favour the previous trend that means its generally a continuation follow emperorbtc there could be several types of reversals distribution accumulation pattern reversals tops and bottoms trend continuation consolidation occurs which turns out to be accumulation price continues upwards signs of guesses resistance being touched continuously the more times resistance is touched the weaker it becomes we could guess that its going to break to an upside follow emperorbtc in the previous tweet we could have used volume and other indicators too but i just wanted to use the pa notice the retest of the high of the breakout candle this is extremely bullish tops a simple pa observation shows lower high being formed continuous test of support weakening support breach with volume used for confirmation follow emperorbtc tops bonus here is a clear indication of a top in bitcoin back in i saw the obv being used on tone vays broadcast by an analyst i dont remember their name but i got the insight from there the reasons are explained in the chart distribution here is a beautiful example of breakdown after consolidation after a head and shoulders is being formed on the bitcoin chart hs is confirmed by volume the breakdown is confirmed by volume too follow emperorbtc conclusion reversals dont happen suddenly but after signs of strength in case of upward movement weakness in case of a breakdown consolidation in continuation or reversal it can be guessed by pa or using pa with momentum or volume indicators ive explained the relevant part needed for trading reversals there are infinite patterns that form at reversals but the main concepts remain the same study the consolidation find the signs or strengthweakness this completed reversal leave a

and invalidation of a trade candlesticks line charts bar charts candlestick charts anatomy of a candlestick trade size how to calculate correct position sizes margin trading pros and cons on trading with leverage i risk management trade setup a trade setup is a thought through plan where you have decided to enter a trade based off technical analysis an entry point is where you will place your orders to enter a trade a stop loss is where your position will be totally closed for a loss if hit a take profit is where your position will be totally closed for a win if hit stop loss is not placed in an arbitrary place eg away but where we are wrong on our trade idea take profit is essential in order to not get greedy and wait for some movement to occurs and loose profits a poor entry would be just buying when price is going up out of fear of mission out emotional trading i risk management summary • trading is a probabilities game in which it is impossible to expect win rate over time • know where your invalidation is before you enter a trade knowing where you are wrong is just as important as where you are correct • always place a stop loss as it is there to protect you always place a take profit as it is there to stop you getting greedy and eventually seeing wins turn to losses • have a full plan for every trade before you enter it is very important do not be afraid of taking a loss it is normal in trading you just have to get into a point in your trading career where you take more wins than losses and that will come with time ii candlesticks line chart is an old western type of charts its among the simplest one simple represents the progression of price in time its very easy to read how price has moved in the past ii candlesticks bar chart it gives more information ● green and red colors gives insights where the price has moved up or down between a given time frame ● you can see the relation between when the price has open and closes in a given time frame ii candlesticks japanese candlestick chart similar to the bar chart easier to read gives clues on what might be happen next as you can distill patterns ii candlesticks how to read a candlestick highest price of the timeframe candles refers always to a given time frame every interval of the time frame a new candle is created opening price closing price the difference between the opening price and the closing price is called body of the candle the highest price and lowest price in relation to the candle body forms a shadow or a wick of the candle lowest price of the timeframe ii candlesticks summary • candlesticks consist of elements ohlc open high low close • they give insights in how price has behaved within a given timeframe • the body of the candle represents where has been the most interest during the candle time • the wicks are visualization of where price attempted to go but failed to remain iii trade size example always know the risk before you enter a trade you must have

risky and is not recommended not more of for the beginners iv margin trading example leverage leverage position size position size borrowed from the exchange if prices increases by you will have in profit if prices increases by you will have in profit if prices drops by you will lose if prices drops by you will lose iv margin trading use leverage sensibly • going all in into one trade indicates poor risk management • use leverage sensibly • use adequate risk management favorable example situation your portfolio diversified across different exchanges and you are using multiple trading accounts you have a portfolio worth but only are allocated on an exchange the rest is in another exchange or stored in a hardware wallet you can use leverage to meet the desired position size even though you don’t have the required money on the exchange you want to take the trade with the appropriate risk management you can use leverage to take the trade with the desired position size without moving funds around basics key notes • always protect your capital • risk management is the key • never enter a trade without a plan know your invalidation and targets • horizontals are very strong and important levels therefore they should be marked correctly on the chart • always use two consecutive candle closes to mark a level • support becomes resistance when broken and resistance turns into support when broken • market structure is the king • develop a daily routine always do your ta and make a plan before trading key theory risk management trading edge trade planning supports and resistances how to map support resistances and horizontal levels sr and rs flips when resistance is broken it become support and when support is broken it becomes resistance market structure b how markets move daily routines preparation for a day of trading basics key theory risk management trading edge trade planning key theory trading takes time • • • • never stop nobody got to where they are now by only working at do not expect to be a professional trader and only chart hours a week losses are normal in trading keep going you need to put in the time and accept losses to learn from them years is the average amount of time is required for a trader to become profitable one key aspect that distinguish professional traders from amateurs is consistency in taking profitable trades find a strategy that works best for you and just repeat it processoriented trading trading is not easymoney it is very difficult and timeconsuming to become profitable key theory not a getrichquick scheme • • don’t focus on the smallterm picture but rather on the longterm vision trading is about longevity with toprisk management the longterm vision must be of staying in a consistent gains over time eg compound interest example one trader risks of his account on each trade while the second one risks of his account on each trade if each trader has losing trades in a row the first one will have left while the second will remain with only binance has the feature of scaling the trade size to of your account to basically take your money trade total account risk trade trade total account risk trade key theory – risk management method risk per trade • always know the risk before you enter a trade you must have your setup in play before entering the trade • is not the trade amount but the risk should we lose the trade the biggest loss we will ever take is at maximum of the portfolio this method is good for low balance accounts or less if you are consistent you can scale up to if you are a beginner start even with you should never take a trade with less than to riskreward ratio better more or equal than to risk management is important as if not more than the technical analysis itself longevity is key if your risk on any given position is small relative to total capital then you can take a losing streak key theory – risk management method risk per trade example we have a account – we will risk loss of the portfolio with each trade of 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒂𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 𝑹𝒊𝒔𝒌 𝑨𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 𝒊𝒏 𝒅𝒐𝒍𝒍𝒂𝒓 · 𝑺𝒕𝒐𝒑 𝑳𝒐𝒔𝒔 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝒈𝒊𝒗𝒆𝒏 𝒃𝒚 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒔𝒆𝒕𝒖𝒑 for a trade with a given stop loss at a from the entry point we have 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒂𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 · we are risking of total portfolio with a stop loss trade for a stop loss the trade amount for the example above will be 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒂𝒎𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕 · key theory – risk management method of equity risk management • never risk more than of total portfolio equity per trade • every trade taken is between and normally at the lower end this method works for bigger accounts few millions not viable for small balance account of a account is not enough example with a trading account the max trade size is and the average trade is longevity is key if your risk on any given position is small relative to total capital then you can take a losing streak key theory there is no best way to trade • • • there is no right or wrong ways to trade only the way that works for you pick an area and master it swing scalp crypto stocks don’t practice on crypto and then start investing in gold a strategy does not have to be complicated the simpler it is the better the majority of time don’t trade with information overload you don’t need a hundred of indicators if you are adding into a strategy or removing from a strategy always ask is this increasing profitability or reducing risk if the answer is yes then add it to the strategy key theory what is your edge strategy • • • • without a strategy you are gambling you have to know where your trading edge is as a trader you should have no opinion just trade the charts the charts never lies to you if you have opinion you will continue to take losses you need to workout your strategy edge to become consistent profitable over time stay humble there is always something to learn to improve and become a better trader your trading edge needs to adjust continuously what works now does not necessarily works in a year whoever says that he never takes a loss is a liar key theory have a plan • • • know when you are going to get out of the trade before you get in stick to you plan always treat your trading methodology like a business simple effective and rememberable if you have a profitable plan but then you take a losing streak you can adjust it just don’t think that the plan is totally a failure plans does not need to be complicated always ask “is this increasing profitability or reducing risk” before adjusting your plan if you go in a losing streak don’t keep trading take a break don’t revengetrade increasing the amount of money traded instead reduce it eg reduce the risk to basics supports and resistances how to map support resistances and horizontal levels supports and resistances identifying supports and resistances • • you want to see multiple touches onto the support or resistance on a high term time frame monthly weekly daily you must master horizontal levels before proceeding to more advanced tools many traders overlook horizontal support and resistances but basics are more pivotal in trading than advanced theories some levels requires more experience as they might seem washed out and not important anymore but they could become important in some cases if you mark out an incorrect horizontal level you will likely loose money never trade of horizontals alone always seek for confluence eg fibonacci retracement which is also horizontals supports and resistances how to map horizontals • • start on higher time frames htf and work your way down monthly ⮕ weekly ⮕ daily ⮕ the higher the timeframe the bigger the supportresistance is if you are day trading you can also map horizontals on timeframe example color system used by daniel monthly purple weekly yellow daily teal cyan orange • • quickly identify levels directly on the chart add templates on tradingview for each color use horizontal ray or horizontal line ltc monthly supports and resistances how to map horizontals example we are looking for levels which has got several touches at least touches on the monthly for a touch is intended when the candle body does not close above the level support and resistance levels are levels where price doesn’t stay there for an extended amount of time three weeks in a row on the same level massive support on massive monthly levels identified by multiple touches price can also come close and make a retracement without even touching them support note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles ltc monthly supports and resistances how to map horizontals example resistance support support note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles ltc monthly supports and resistances how to map horizontals example resistance some of the monthly levels can be redefined by looking at the weekly timeframe if they don’t look quite right resistance support support note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles ltc weekly supports and resistances how to map horizontals example tweezer top not something to likely label always look to the left before going to the right levels are chart specific each asset handle levels differently no clear levels here note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles support no candle body close below the level bounce on the weekly support ltc daily supports and resistances how to map horizontals example when a daily level is right next to a weekly level there’s no point in adding the daily as well resistance no points in adding this daily level as it is near a weekly level note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles ltc daily supports and resistances how to map horizontals example price reaction on horizontal levels note daniel changed his style from wicks to bodies of the candles supports and resistances trendlines trend lines use the same theory of horizontals you need to see at least two touches to create the trend line touch touches can be viewed as a strong speculative buy touches is an already confirmed trendline touch touch breakthrough of the trendline many traders do not trade the touch but daniel does and often the touch goes through basics sr and rs flips when resistance is broken it become support and when support is broken it becomes resistance bat sr and rs flips support when broken becomes resistance if there are signals of a level being broken its better to go out of the trade once broken supports flips into resistances going forward bounces on the support are getting smaller and smaller until its broken like a ball there’s no much time that you can hold up a level until its buyers exhausts it’s all about supply and demand if you have an area that people are interested in buying but the bounces are getting smaller and smaller it means there’s less sellers then less people are holding up that level and you need to come back down in search for value at a lower price you then see if at that lower level there are people interested in buying or it is still over valued you can reach a value where there is an “agreement” between buyers and sellers and that is when you stay range bound accumulation range support levels good entries for short positions finding a fair value for an asset is all about trading eos good entries for long positions sr and rs flips resistance when broken becomes support resistance level same of sr flips just reversed if you are looking for long or short positions you want to wait for a breakthrough a backtest and a confirmation of the sr or rs flip consolidation under resistance is bullish especially in an uptrend once broken resistances flips into support going forward btc once trendline support is broken it flips into resistance going forward sr and rs flips trendline support when broken becomes resistance trendlines flips strategy is the same as horizontals in uptrend or downtrend lines trendline is acting as support basics market structure how markets move market structure as confluence market structure the fundamentals • reading the market structure ms gives you the ability to identify a trend at any given timeframe • market structure helps you build a case for a potential trade bullish or bearish • with market structure you can identify when a trend has ended and is about to reverse find other form of confluence before enter a trade to determine entry and invalidation point enter a trade only based on a change in market structure might be difficult because the ranges can be very wide especially on swing trading on high time frames market structure directions of the market upwards downwards sideways trending uptrend trending downtrend consolidation breaking the newly made high confirms the uptrend market structure uptrend when price breaches the previous price high it makes a higher high and does not close below the previous low it makes a higher low establishes an uptrend higher high the uptrend is confirmed when the next high is higher than the previous higher high after the confirmation long positions are favorable as the uptrend il likely to continue high higher low low market structure downtrend high the same as the uptrend but reversed lower high the downtrend is confirmed when the new lower high is lower than the previous high lower high low lower low breaking the newly made low confirms the downtrend market structure no new higher highs are being made higher high sideways after a higher high and a higher low coming from an uptrend or a lower high and a lower low coming from a downtrend no new higher or lower highslows are made the result is indecision in price forming a sideway range high a breakout on either sides might occur you can trade inside the range from low to high or high to low you can trade the breakout of the channel as well after confirmation higher low price was forming a potential uptrend no new lower lows are being made after breaking the previous high and making a higher low price continues past the newly made high higher high market structure trend change coming from an established downtrend the price will place a lower low followed by a higher high and a higher low after breaching the new higher high the trend change from downtrend to uptrend is confirmed high after the confirmation you might start looking for a long position lower high coming from an established uptrend higher low the price will place a higher high followed by a lower high and a lower low after breaching the new lower low the trend change from uptrend to downtrend is confirmed after the confirmation you might start looking for a short position low lower low market structure trend change – complex scenario change of trend confirmed only after breaching the start of the down trend we can confirm new higher highs higher high higher high high lower high start of the downtrend still lower high lower high higher low low still lower low lower low lower low downward trendline is being broken early indication that the trend might change market structure support and resistance in order for a trend change to occur old highs or old lows has to be breached it does make sense to pull horizontal lines from older highs and lows backtest in order to see if there is interest in buying at this level otherwise price continues down where price couldn’t breach previous highs means that in that particular level there’s not enough demand as a result the price goes down and the high becomes a resistance resistance support resistance high support once the price breaks through a resistance or support level it is common to backtest it in order to see if there is buyingselling interest now if there’s still no interest the level flip from resistance to support or vice versa market structure is the source of these basic concepts determining where are demand and supply low the higher the time frame the more resistant is the level backtest in order to see if there is enough interest to buy for price to continues up levels are taken from candle closes basics daily routines preparation for a day of trading daily routines routine mark out key levels • • • • • plan all possible setups take trades that ‘comes to me’ routine to be prepared for the day ahead knowing and predicting the best potential setup before the setup is even there be prepared for a bullish or a bearish scenario you must be already ready before the majority of the competition are still working out the plan only take the trade when the setup has been met if you don’t have a plan your plan is to fail not making a trade is a trade in itself daily routines daily sheet all key reference levels and planned setups to take to be prepared for them before they are visible • recognize if there is a bullish or bearish daily open • recognize if the initial balance is strong or not • aware of where the big reference levels are daily routines context you really need to working the context out in the morning it gives you the base understanding and instructions for the day keep context as simple as possible avoid analysis paralysis use the setup and tools that you feel more comfortable with determine your daily bias bullish or bearish trend direction sideways or trending higher time frame elliott wave count watch td on ltf and on htf and get the context of the direction if price is trending in wave aggressively long the dips compound and trail stop loss trending buy the dips and put a trailing stop loss do not take profit often sideways does not add to position buys at the low and sell at the high of the range cvd divergences when in sideways range look for cvd divergences to get the context of what the biggest traders are doing if price is in a wave triangle expect ranges take profits long lows and short highs daily routines important levels cc fibonacci global and local hour emas and pocs daily weekly monthly the global cc is taken from very htf and not interacted with it so much but when it does expect big moves represents support and resistance levels on hours levels where to take trades from the local cc is derived from ltf mostly useful for day traders and are the most respected levels of ema look for confluence with other tools to determine probability of the trade daily routines key horizontal levels biggest trading levels key support and resistance of the day determined by looking for several layers of confluence manually determined there’s no indicators for that if there is a strong resistance level but during the day we break through it when it is retest you can expect to flip as support after identifying the context and the key horizontal levels you can patiently wait for the trade setup comes toward your plan daily routines volume information look at your statistics and journaling keeping your statistics is one of the major way to become a successful trader open interest daily volume and delta funding bullish or bearish what’s the open interest doing on the previous day check if volume and delta are increasing in comparison to previous days current funding check if open interest is increasing or not check discrepancies with open interest daily routines opens and notes prepare for daily weekly monthly opens strategies daniel will give on the daily sheet his key notes for the day ahead identify levels and setup before price reach that levels is extremely useful to become successful a daily sheet requires minutes place alerts and when they hit look for a trade in minutes the rest of the time is free watching a chart a day will not make you a better trader start formulate your plans and then trade them trading psychology key notes • trading without emotions is the key • stick to your plan • truly understand and accept the calculated risk on your trade • greed makes you lose money • when you focus on trading money comes naturally important if you want to take trading seriously do the trades with one dollar challenge as described in a stream trading mindset introduction into trading psychology psychology introduction trading emotions risk management and trading steps before each trade psychology in trading focus on charts and trades do not be greedy trading emotions how to handle trading emotions psychology trading mindset introduction into trading psychology trading mindset working out a trading strategy do you second guess yourself when entering trades have fear during the trade not stick to your original plan of the trade have a plan at all before entering a trade or do you enter the trade in fomo a lot of key points are taken from mark douglas of traders lose money because they don’t have a plan at all trading mindset understanding and accepting the risk people accept they can lose but they do not accept the risk of loosing it example bad trade after our ta or due to fomo we take a long trade with stop loss and take profit set each downwards move causes fear and each upwards move causes hopegreed after an initial uptrend the market structure starts to clearly change with a series of lower low and lower high after the first confirmation of the ms change we say to our self “if it goes below the lower low andor my invalidation point we’ll close” but at every lower high we start to feel that the market might goes up again but punctually it goes down we continue like this until we are liquidated or with a high loss use your invalidation point to get out of the trade don’t stick with a bad trade after it hits your first invalidation point just with the idea that maybe the things are going to change no emotions just trade the chart trading mindset we can lose any trade we take we must accept the risk before entering any trade and we must accept that we can lose any trade we take therefore it’s crucial to put a stop loss and a take profit on each trade we take we are trading probabilities using a probabilistic edge we must be the casino owning the slot machines not only the players example weighted coin we are betting on a weighted coin that has odds of head are we going to put all our life saving on heads no because there is a change that we can loose but we are more willing to take the risk over a course of coins flips because more often than not heads will be the result but you can’t never ever know with a certainty if the next coin flip is head or not all it takes is other person to invalidate any trade and ta we take we still can loose any trade given by our best setup it does not matter how the next trade goes we are trading in a way that on the long term our probabilities to win are higher as a casino owner we know that sometimes players can win and take money from us but on the long term at the end of the day we are walking away with money trading mindset trading strategy challenge work out a setup you are going to take for the next trades and take that setup every time does not matter what others are saying block anything else on each trade use only and record each trade result what went wrong and what could be improved at the end see your win and if any adjustments need to be made if your win rate is higher than the lose rate you can scale up the same setup for bigger trades but if on bigger trades you find yourself exiting the trade sooner or changing the strategy along the way then go back to smaller trades until you find your personal risk tolerance if you are taking trading seriously you need to do this challenge make only dollar trades as you need to find this disciplines first and then you can scale up if you can do the challenge with there’s no reason that you can’t do it with a you need to find a systematic and robotic strategy to trade with no emotions trading mindset the secret to trading “no man ever reached to excellence in any one art or profession without having passed through the slow and painful process of study and preparation” trade without fear or overconfidence when you get a trade setup stop over thinking and think in a percentage over a series of trades perspective instead of try to find the best indicators the best strategy in the hope that the next trade will not be lose acknowledge the fact that is impossible to avoid losses in trading and that we need to trade with a probabilistic edge if you are not willing to accept the risk probably you are trading with too much money winning at trading is easy it takes care of itself but learning how to lose is the most important part as a trader how i deal with losing mentally is extremely important in trading do i let it bother me do i hang on to it or do i release it and let it go when i lose i have to experience the loss feel it learn from it and then spit it out and let it go and focus on the next trade if i hang on to a loss for too long it will pollute me it will affect my next trade and i always have to focus on the next trade the next trade is the most important trade in the world focus on the now i need to know myself the sooner i figure out who and what i am as a trader and play to my strengths the sooner i can work out how to remove my weaknesses when i can completely divorce myself from the money madelost aspect of trading and just focus on the market and making good trades i’ll be a much better trader biggest lessons learned selfbelief believe in myself don’t quit and never lose all my money overall it’s stay in the game and really believe in myself it’s a balancing act between having an ego compared to having too big of an ego know what my strengths and weaknesses are it’s a game of inner exploration mentally traders all now trade from screens a few feet away i shouldn’t be doing that i should be internalizing the screens and making them a part of me eg what i see on the screens should be a part of my psyche it’s not me against the machine the machine data on screens should be part of me sometimes have these zenmoments where clears mind of all thoughts and will be looking at the screen but not actually looking at it but know you subconscious is looking at it then he comes out of this zenlike moment looks at the screen and is like “right i know what to do” observational skills in order to be a good trader i really need to work on my observational skills i need to notice what the market is telling me dont sit there and say “based on the charts the month chart btc is going to xyz level” no lets the market tell you what to do dont won’t buy btc unless the market is yelling at you “buy the bloody bitcoin you idiot” divorce yourself from the opinion and lets the market tell you what to do watch the markets closely but not too closely as sometimes one can look at the screen look away from the screen look back and one’s subconscious mind then tells one what’s there and what to do use the power of observation intuition and subconscious mind as these are very powerful tools when it comes to trading i must have an openmind and be nonjudgmental open myself up to everything utilize the fact that my spirit inside wants to be open and free to everything don’t let anything stand in my way don’t let any dogmasbeliefs stop me from achieving what i want to achieve don’t just watch the market listen to it the markets are always changing so i must adapt my trading to the market changes grow my account organically don’t try to grow it too fast if you start with and take it up to take a couple of grand out and start again build build build i must stand the test of time there’s a selfsabotage in a lot of traders they love the challenge of trading and the climb up the hill eg taking a account to as that’s where the thrill is the climbing up the hill they make a bunch of money and then their subconscious mind says i don’t like this i like the challenge of climbing up the hill so they make silly bets don’t manage risk and eventually blow up just so they can have the thrill of climbing that hill again i must know myself really well to ensure this selfsabotage doesn’t happen to me have an honest chat with myself as this will help me decide what to do and what not to do it’s really important that i don’t beat myself up when i lose money or miss a trade it’s going to happen just get on with things challenge your brain all the time the brain likes order and to file things away but it’s good to throw a challenge in there to keep things fresh whether that’s learning something new about trading options futures ta fa or a new language or taking up sudoku also change things up across my life instead of doing the same old same old even minor things like the way i drive to place i visit a lot take a different route solve problems know its hard to do when starting out but eventually after you evolve into a successful trader you will only focus on the now of trading i won’t care about big wins or big losses or how much money i’m making i’ll just be focused on the next trade and making good trades overall trading mindset daniel’s post and summary we are the casino we have the edges in our favur loses are expected but over trades we walk away with more money trading mindset summary a trading strategyplan is needed accept you can lose every trade taken stick to the plan till the very end of the data set psychology psychology introduction trading emotions risk management and trading steps before each trade psychology introduction how to manage emotions i have no trust in my setups i lost my confidence after a string of losses i’m scared to enter a trade i feel the pressure when i start to understand how market works or when i see other people succeeding i feel the tension of having money on the line not have enough sleep example missed move due to lack of confidence a setup with great confluence presents itself but you doubt your analysis and do not take the trade maybe you overthink a few recent losses or you have analysis paralysis and decide to skip the trade the result is devastating as the trade went exactly as you planned it would go this plant in your emotions for every future trade you can overcome this emotions with a plan and by focusing approaching trading as a business with the proper risk management putting just the required amount of effort psychology psychology in trading focus on charts and trades do not be greedy psychology in trading trading mindset • the greatest and most successful traders find their main reward in the activity of trading itself • if you suffer from fear and greed it’s because you don’t understand yourself most traders win or lose to the same degree that they understand themselves • seeing the market as support mechanism and not as threatening is the critical difference in achieving success so many people are good at charting but not at trading when you have money on the line it changes focus on the chart and trades and the money will come naturally focus on yourself when you are entering a market scared money does not make money you cannot win every trade when you over analyze you’ll become scared of taking trades based on your setup you will always find something that will not make you do the trade psychology in trading trading mindset • emotions and feelings in trading are something that professional traders do not get or block out when entering trades • professional traders feel a connection with the market and have a knack of knowing what is going to happen next information knowledge and edges seem to come out of nowhere • trading is effortless “knowing without knowing how i know” professionals know that they don’t have any control over the market but they start to “know without knowing” even after a positive winning streak if you feel too powerful and unstoppable take a break and come back with a new mindset don’t be too greedy psychology in trading take responsibility for your trades don’t put blame on everybody else than you “my broker told me to go long and i knew it was wrong” “the rsi said to buy and it was wrong” “i knew i should have sold but the wave count was wrong” a key principle in becoming a consistent trader is acting responsibly for your trades a trade journal is a good way to keep accountability and monitoring wins and losses you need to learn from losses analyze what went wrong psychology in trading trade journal you want some form of analysis for the trade you take in order to come back later on this is a key metric for moving forward and becoming a better trader psychology trading emotions how to handle trading emotions trading emotions negative emotions fear depression usually directly correlated to the size of positions we are using and what kind of leverage we are using after a series of negative trading you start to take trades you shouldn’t take not using setups or revenge trading fear is a key emotion to control this ends in a downward spiral of emotions into depression with idea of quitting from trading trading emotions positive emotions greed euphoria after a positive streak of trades you start to believe that the trades will go always better and you leave the position open after hitting the take profits believing you are unstoppable and that you are the best trader in the world you should not have this type of emotion you should be careful when you start to feeling greed when you feel euphoric take a break or reduce your position size trading emotions manage emotions find your center get in the zone find your center try to get in the zone be calm not greedy try to manage your feelings and emotions if you had a bad day or other external feelings they are definitely going to affect your trading be aware of that trading on a mobile phone means probably that you where doing something else trading requires focus and no distractions trading emotions risk management protect your capital stick to your plan no trade is also a trade leverage is a hell of a drug treat it like it don’t use it often and carefully pretend you have a million account would you also manage trades in the same way or you will be more careful do your ta and your plan you know where your risk is and your maximum pain point in order to stop no trading is also recognizing that there’s no trade that have enough probabilities or that the edge is not there don’t let leverage ruin your risk management trading emotions trading steps before each trade find the confluence pick a position size that fits your account execute position size must take in consideration leverage as well picking the right position size will eliminate the fear as you know exactly how you’re going to lose execute you need to take risk without risk you can’t make money trading emotions focus focus mentally and physically eat food that keep your mind sharp do regular exercises do the same activities you will do to master any type of profession entering trades key notes • recognize high liquidity areas • use wide stop loss adjust position size accordingly • find high liquidity places price is drawn towards them • always look for confluence and what is the most probable to happen • laddering into a trade and compounding is very useful • work out what is your preferred strategy of entering a trade • consider a checklist before entering a trade consolidation consolidation above support and consolidation below resistance compounding averaging down laddering different ways how to enter and manage trades swing failure pattern and liquidity places where there is a lot of buyingselling activity trade entry strategy different options how to enter a trade preset market alarm old swing failure pattern and liquidity old places where there is a lot of buyingselling activity entering trades consolidation consolidation above support and consolidation below resistance xbtusd hourly consolidation price breaks consolidation range backtest it and then move up again impulsively for the continuation of the trend what is consolidation consolidation basically consists of a sideway range and an extended one not just a small price correction when price is moving up impulsively you will get little to none sideway consolidation consolidation is just the asset working out to find a fair price supply and demand if the price is expanding upwards is due to the fact that less people wants to sell and more people wants to buy once price reach a level where people is comfortable selling but people fill that the price is still high you have a drop in price consolidation could also be downward sloping more bullish or upward sloping unhealthy and overextended backtest is not necessary but most of the time it happens and is really nice not real consolidation price expanding impulsively price moving in a sideway range consolidation usually a neutral pattern it can break on the upside or downside but one could slightly favor continuation of the trend textbook trading is so different than real trading if you straight jump from textbook advice to real trading you will definitely lose money consolidation forms of consolidation sideways favor continuation to the upside but it is general neutral downward slope bullish best form of consolidation bull flag upward slope still uptrending but does not guarantee a strong consolidation and future corrections might be bigger the price is more overextended xbtusd hourly consolidation there are not so many times sellers can hold up a level before they become exhausted other factors must be considered for the pros and cons of each position market bullish or bearish as it could also be a low risk short generally in an uptrend this should break through resistance consolidation under resistance is bullish if you have a level of resistance and you keep hitting that resistance there’s only so much time people can sell before it goes through to find a new fair level there is real demand and you must go higher to find a new level of supply resistance is broken and then flipped into support for a long trade btcusd weekly consolidation consolidation above support is bearish textbooks classifies consolidation above support is bearish for the same reason of the consolidation under resistance there are not so many times buyers can hold up a level before they become exhausted the end of consolidation and the break down of the support level represent the fact that at this price no other buyers can be found and then a new lower fair value is needed consolidation consolidation counter argument consolidation above support offers a low risk long consolidation below resistance offers a low risk short always look for a higher time frame bias or another technical tool for confluence before entering a trade longing below resistance or shorting above support is like buying into resistances and selling into support not a wise trading strategy do not blindly short when you are consolidating above support nor long when you are consolidating below resistance always look for confluence trends are really strong don’t try to fight them consolidation tips for trading consolidations look at the trends look at the coinciding variables don’t look at one thing in its own look at the bigger time frames to figure out the bigger picture look at the resistances and supports and think what’s most likely given the other variables entering trades compounding averaging down laddering different ways how to enter and manage trades btcusd min compounding averaging down laddering compounding trades compounding a trade is when you are already in one trade and then another setup presents itself in the trade with a good risk to reward ratio and a trade you would take if you were not already in the trade the second trade you take is a trade in itself that you would likely take on its own with compounding you are adding a second position to the setup that is compounding your gains only take the second compound trade only if it is a setup in itself nice confluence and second trade setup once you added the compound trade you can move the first stop loss on the second stop loss in order to end always in profits laddering adds more complexity to a setup but another level of risk as well practice first btcusd min compounding averaging down laddering averaging down trades averaging down adds another trade to a currently loosing position you are essentially averaging down you long price as you are expecting further moves upside first level of support the same technic is appliable to shorts as well only average down if there is a second level of strong support that makes it worth to averaging if after the second entry the conditions of the market change you might try to close the first position at break even the second position might also be bigger in order to close at break even sooner second support if you are a beginner do not average down at the beginning its better to cut out of the trade and take the loss without further risks btcusd hourly compounding averaging down laddering laddering into trades laddering into a trade is when you don’t want to place all your orders in one place it’s almost impossible to buy the exact bottom or short the exact top thus laddering into a position makes sense useful where the entry price could be in a range eg in a fib retracement from and it allows nor to lose the move if the bounce happens early nor to lose a better entry price by averaging the entry price in a defined range it’s different than averaging down as it is a planned setup in order to enter between given levels laddering adds more complexity to a setup entering trades swing failure pattern and liquidity places where there is a lot of buyingselling activity swing failure pattern and liquidity liquidity zones example bigger traders liquidity problem you’re a big trader and you’re trading with multiple million dollars while the price is currently in a low volume range there are options to enter with a limit order or with a market order a big entry size could cause issues if the average volume in the range is on average much smaller than your entry volume if you place a limit order it might never get filled as there are not enough sellersbuyers in that range while if you place a market order it could become a doubleedged sword and your entries will gets filled while price is moving on a longer period is not easy for a big trader to enter at a desired position the best strategy will be to find the place where most of the market orders are sitting for your limit order to gets filled as market orders solely moves the price in other terms grabbing liquidity the largest amount of market orders transactions are going to take place where all stop losses are placed cause most of the people have their stop losses set as a limit order market orders are the orders that actually move the price while limit orders don’t in other terms market orders take liquidity out of the market while limit orders provide it people usually feel safe to place their stop losses in levels backed up by ta by the structure of the price usually belowabove a significant lowhigh point in price abovebelove a consolidation area these are good spot for placing stop losses but also good spot for bigger orders to get filled swing failure pattern and liquidity swing failure pattern • swing failure patterns sfp are attempts to swing belowabove a significant lowhigh but failing to do so not closing above or below the level with a candle close but doing so only with a wick • after an sfp the price can resume a previous trend start a reversal or make a bounce • sfps happens on all time frames the higher the time frame the more significant its effect long positions have most likely put their stop losses below the support level creating liquidity support level liquidity swing failure pattern are also called stop hunts or liquidity grabs breaching a high or a low doesn’t necessary means that a sfp will occurs sfps can either trade into a shortterm retracement or a complete reversal icxbtc swing failure pattern and liquidity how does a sfp looks like visually a sfp candle takes out the high and close back above the previous low the higher the close of a sfp candle is the strongest it is sfp takes out the high and close back above previous low significant and global support level everyone is waiting for a trend change or a bounce previous low sfp happens all the time especially in btc depending on the trend btcusd swing failure pattern and liquidity sfp at a high before a major drop sfps on bitcoin sfp happens all the time especially in btc depending on the trend sfp on the lows for a local trend reversal when bitmex was widely used sfps were more frequent and on a larger scale but now they remain important and quite frequent notice how not all sfp result in a change of the local or global trend context is important btc likes to do a lot of sfps in part because the market is highly leveraged btcusd sfp high provides an invalidation point price ranging at a resistance level swing failure pattern and liquidity from scalp to swing trade using sfps swing failure patterns provide clear invalidation points if price goes back to the level of the sfp then the sfp is no longer valid and the trade setup invalidated if the sfp closes inside the range you can at poc if range is big enough and at the low of the range allowing you to let the trade run if the range is broken transforming the scalp trade into a swing trade with the best setup due to the sfp invalidation point a sfp closed inside the range giving a clear invalidation point swing failure pattern and liquidity how to trade sfps – beginner setup wait for the price to take the highlow wait for a candle close below the previous highlow and back within the local range tp at the bottomtop of the range compound or let the trade run as ms changes note this is a trade setup for beginners without the need to use volume or footprint data but only the price chart swing failure pattern and liquidity how to trade sfps – advanced setup look for trapped traders look for demand to show up look for a change in market structure do not try to catch the knife wait for at least step or for a higher probability trade for step if you wait for step you will have a clear invalidation area stop loss belowabove the lowhigh of the sfp as most probably liquidity has already been taken with the sfp swing failure pattern and liquidity sfp – advanced setup trapped traders for a sfp on a low ● high activity at the lows of the candle lots of high volume on the lower part of the candle selling imbalances red squares on exocharts ● longs getting stopped out decline of open interest ● new shorts opening people turning very bearish higher volume and higher negative delta on the last low selling imbalances orange squares opening on the lower part of the candle decline of open interest longs closing lower volume and delta less negative extra confluence the selling must not be as aggressive as it was on the previous low by looking at volume and negative delta ideally on sfp volume and negative delta must be smaller swing failure pattern and liquidity sfp – advanced setup demand for a sfp on a low ● look for big buying imbalances green squares demand shows up buying imbalances green squares on exocharts ● increase in open interest new longs opening extra confluence volume becomes positive and the delta increases increase in open interest new longs opening up be extracareful as imbalances could also represent shorts getting stopped out so always check confluence with open interest shorts are trapped at the lows as new longs are open since the new longs will likely defend their position swing failure pattern and liquidity sales are bought up by imbalances black boxes with green text this indicates that traders are now more interested in buying rather than selling sfp – advanced setup demand zoomed longs opening while shorts are closing at the same time generate a lot of buying imbalances longs opening while shorts are being stopped out if a trader with long gets stopped out by the new low below the stop loss when he see the price retrace in the desired direction force him to enter a new trade with a market order generating new imbalances in this case due to fomo entering trades trade entry strategy different options how to enter a trade preset market alarm trade entry strategy preset order commonly used by swing traders removes a lot of ‘in the action’ emotions and changing of plan when price reaches level can cause unnecessary losses removes emotions when price is approaching a previously identified level without the possibility of monitoring the action at the moment preset orders can cause unnecessary losses as they get executed without any confirmation trade entry strategy market entries commonly used by swing traders and day traders adds an emotional aspect in trading losses should be less common as you are buying from confirmation you can see price action therefore you are not “hoping” anymore that a move occurs with market entries you see that move is occurring and then you get involved can you deal with “not changing your plan” when price is approaching your level you need to conquer that to use market entries trade entry strategy alerts commonly used by swing traders and day traders allows you to review action make an informed trade once the alert goes off you can review the price action prior to place the order you can check cvd divergences if it is blowing through if it is making a nice bounce etc can you deal with “not changing your plan” when price is approaching your level you need to conquer that to use market entries trade entry strategy daniel’s choice daniel uses alerts at level interesting for trades when alert goes off he can review price action volume delta open interest gc gold correlation stock market action ethereum and altcoins action etc make an informed trade with no ‘hope’ with all the information you can review before entering the trade the margin of error is reduced and the risk to reward ratio is increased as the trade is taken on an informed decision alerts allow daniel to enter only trades with the best setup possible and discard all the others with alerts you can always make informed trades and stop making hopes trades in any case there is always the risk of losing btcusd min trade entry strategy would you put a preset order on the cc in an uptrend will you put a preset order on a well defined cc level and walk away preset order above cc price retraced due to a liquidation run strike through the cc level and the low in a few hours if you had any preset order you probably ended stopped out tight sl if you had placed an alert instead you would have been able to see that the price went strike through the cc without any reaction therefore avoiding you to place a trade entering trades old swing failure pattern and liquidity places where there is a lot of buyingselling activity old swing failure pattern and liquidity the bucketshop drive story i was only twenty when i first accumulated ten thousand dollars in cash and you ought to have heard my mother you’d have thought that ten thousand dollars in cash was more than anybody carried around except old john d and she used to tell me to be satisfied and go into some regular business i had a hard time convincing her that i was not gambling but making money by figuring but all she could see was that ten thousand dollars was a lot of money and all i could see was more margin i had put out my shares of sugar at ¼ of today there was another fellow in the room henry williams who was short shares i used to sit by the ticker and call out the quotations for the board boy the price behaved as i thought it would it promptly went down a couple of points and paused a little to get its breath before taking another dip the general market was pretty soft and everything looked promising then all of a sudden i didn’t like the way sugar was doing its hesitating i began to feel uncomfortable i thought i ought to get out of the market then it sold at that was low for the day but instead of feeling more confident i felt more uncertain i knew something was wrong somewhere but i couldn’t spot it exactly but if something was coming and i didn’t know where from i couldn’t be on my guard against it that being the case i’d better be out of the market you know i don’t do things blindly i don’t like to i never did even as a kid i had to know why i should do certain things but this time i had no definite reason to give to myself and yet i was so uncomfortable that i couldn’t stand it i called to a fellow i knew dave wyman and said to him “dave you take my place here i want you to do something for me wait a little before you call out the next price of sugar will you” he said he would and i got up and gave him my place by the ticker so he could call out the prices for the boy i took my seven sugar tickets out of my pocket and walked over to the counter to where the clerk was who marked the tickets when you closed your trades but i didn’t really know why i should get out of the market so i just stood there leaning against the counter my tickets in my hand so that the clerk couldn’t see them pretty soon i heard the clicking of a telegraph instrument and i saw tom burnham the clerk turn his head quickly and listen then i felt that something crooked was hatching and i decided not to wait any longer just then dave wyman by the ticker began “su…” and quick as a flash i slapped my tickets on the counter in front of the clerk and yelled “close sugar” before dave had finished calling the price so of course the house had to close my sugar at the last quotation what dave called turned out to be again according to my dope sheet sugar should have broken by now the engine wasn’t hitting right i had the feeling that there was a trap in the neighborhoods at all events the telegraph instrument was now going like mad and i noticed that tom burnham the clerk had left my tickets unmarked where i laid them and was listening to the clicking as if he were waiting for something so i yelled at him “hey tom what in hell are you waiting for mark the price on these tickets get a gait on” everybody in the room heard me and began to look toward us and ask what was the trouble for you see while the cosmopolitan had never laid down there was no telling and a run on a bucket shop can start like a run on a bank if one customer gets suspicious the others follow suit so tom looked sulky but came over and marked my tickets “closed at ” and shoved the seven of them over toward me he sure had a sour face say the distance from tom’s place to the cashier’s cage wasn’t over eight feet but i hadn’t got to the cashier to get my money when dave wyman by the ticker yelled excitedly “gosh sugar ” but it was too late so i just laughed and called over to tom “it didn’t work that time did it old boy” of course it was a putup job henry williams and i together were short six thousand shares of sugar that bucket shop had my margin and henry’s and there may have been a lot of other sugar shorts in the office possibly eight or ten thousand shares in all suppose they had of today in sugar margins that was enough to pay the shop to thimblerig the market on the new york stock exchange and wipe us out in the old days whenever a bucket shop found itself loaded with too many bulls on a certain stock it was a common practice to get some broker to wash down the price of that particular stock far enough to wipe out all the customers that were long of it this seldom cost the bucket shop more than a couple of points on a few hundred shares and they made thousands of dollars that was what the cosmopolitan did to get me and henry williams and the other sugar shorts their brokers in new york ran up the price to of course it fell right back but henry and a lot of others were wiped out whenever there was an unexplained sharp drop which was followed by instant recovery the newspapers in those days used to call it a bucketshop drive and the funniest thing was that not later than ten days after the cosmopolitan people tried to doublecross me a new york operator did them out of over seventy thousand dollars this man who was quite a market factor in his day and a member of the new york stock exchange made a great name for himself as a bear during the bryan panic of ’ he was forever running up against stock exchange rules that kept him from carrying out some of his plans at the expense of his fellow members one day he figured that there would be no complaints from either the exchange or the police authorities if he took from the bucket shops of the land some of their illgotten gains in the instance i speak of he sent thirtyfive men to act as customers they went to the main office and to the bigger branches on a certain day at a fixed hour the agents all bought as much of a certain stock as the managers would let them they had instructions to sneak out at a certain profit of course what he did was to distribute bull tips on that stock among his cronies and then he went in to the floor of the stock exchange and bid up the price helped by the room traders who thought he was a good sport being careful to pick out the right stock for that work there was no trouble in putting up the price three or four points his agents at the bucket shops cashed in as prearranged a fellow told me the originator cleaned up seventy thousand dollars net and his agents made their expenses and their pay besides he played that game several times all over the country punishing the bigger bucket shops of new york boston philadelphia chicago cincinnati and st louis one of his favorite stocks was western union because it was so easy to move a semiactive stock like that a few points up or down his agents bought it at a certain figure sold at two points profit went short and took three points more old swing failure pattern and liquidity liquidity • liquidity areas are areas or zones where a lot of trades have taken place or can take place without having a significant effect on its price • liquidity is created on a place where people enter and exit trades where a lot of activity has taken place usually near a point of interest combined of different technical factors fib levels naked pocs market structure • in these places it is likely that many people are having their stops placed slightly below as they are backed up by ta with the knowledge of liquidity we should be able to determine where many traders have most likely placed their stops liquidity run main reasons ● ● ● to fill large position sizes to run liquidity you need a large capital to collect margin for brokersexchanges usually for leveraged positions to force as many people out of the market and create fomo old swing failure pattern and liquidity recognizing liquidity areas • many traders does not take profit and waits for dips to occur to either compound or move up their stop loss as they compound their trades they move their stop losses to the more recent price action and just ride the price until they get stopped out • lower time frames traders use the most recent dips to trade shorter swings or daytrade where would they place their stop losses they place stop losses slightly below areas of confluence for their ta there are different type of traders therefore there are multiple liquidity pools as trend progresses you start building different liquidity pools some bigger than others depending on confluence of ta liquidity runs does not always happen on a trend it’s not a magic formula btcusd old swing failure pattern and liquidity recognizing liquidity areas in a clear uptrend most of the liquidity can be found on the longside as most of the shorts opened during the uptrend has being most probably already stopped out no lower low has been made though most of the people are in their long positions for a while representing a liquidity pool if the uptrend or downtrend is clear and straight without any noticeable corrections there is a good reason to think that liquidity pools has been created during the trend old swing failure pattern and liquidity recognizing liquidity areas liquidity pools could also be recognized by looking at the open interest and the comparison between net longs and net shorts giving the sense of which side investors are more willing to buy if the trend reverse to the downside it has the potential to take out a lot of stop losses old swing failure pattern and liquidity swing failure pattern • in a possible local or global trendreversal scenario eg a downtrend bouncing on a support level swing failure patterns sfp are attempts to swing below or above the significant level but failing to do so with a candle close but doing so only with the candle wick before continuing the reversal • sfps happens on all time frames the higher the time frame the more significant its effect long positions have most likely put their stop losses below the support level creating liquidity support level liquidity • sfp give an opportunity to trade a bounce not every sfp reverses a trend entirely context and confluence are very important swing failure pattern are also called stop hunts or liquidity grabs or even bucketshop drives from story icxbtc old swing failure pattern and liquidity how does a sfp looks like visually a sfp candle takes out the high and close back above the previous low the higher the close of a sfp candle is the strongest it is sfp take out the high and close back above previous low significant and global support level everyone is waiting for a trend change or a bounce previous low sfp happens all the time especially in btc depending on the trend btcusd old swing failure pattern and liquidity sfps on bitcoin sfp happens all the time especially in btc depending on the trend notice how not all sfp result in a change of the local or global trend context is important btcusd old swing failure pattern and liquidity sfp on bitcoin btc likes to do a lot of sfps in part because the market is highly leveraged old swing failure pattern and liquidity how to trade sfps a successful swing failure pattern relies on the following ingredients price breaching past a significant high or low and not closing past that high highest volume near the highlow of the candle trapped trades market structure for confirmation sfps are best to trade at the moment as price can move really fast you can discover an sfp forming by looking at the volume statistics open interest delta volume value areas old swing failure pattern and liquidity spot sfps with volume statistics decline of open interest gets an indication that longs are getting stopped out shorts are opening on the lower part of the candle most of the volume of the candle is in the lower part of the candle high volume on the lower part of the candle shorts orange bars opening on the lower part of the candle decline of open interest volume delta cvd hl old swing failure pattern and liquidity spot sfps with volume statistics – zoomed view as the lows are being challenged it does so on lesser negative delta this shows the move is losing steam heavy selling continues till the very bottom of the low high volume and high negative delta heavy selling into the lows which gets bought up by larger buys indicating buying interest shown as buying imbalances are starting to show up sales are bought up by imbalances black boxes with green text this indicates that traders are now more interested in buying rather than selling sales are bought up by imbalances indicating more interest in buying at the lows we have traders stopped out on their longs and who shorted on the low is now “trapped” in a loosing position this provides fuel to bounce up on the second attempt of taking the low volume decrease and delta increase the move is losing steam volume delta cvd hl old swing failure pattern and liquidity new higher high spot sfps with volume statistics – enter the trade healthy high volume on top of the candles a safer way to trade sfp is to check on statistics and wait for change in market structure for confirmation heavy shorts here once the price goes up they are trapped in a losing position longs that were stopped out are required to bought back in at a higher price and late shorts are required to close their positions this represents more fuel for the bounce up new higher low confirmation of the ms change we have heavy volume and negative delta but the low is never taken volume delta cvd hl old swing failure pattern and liquidity summary key points for a successful sfp and a continuation of the trend for this example uptrending traders being trapped in losing positions or being stopped out increase in volume and positive delta increase in open interest volume at the top of the candle indicators key notes • there are lagging indicators no too useful and leading indicators • daniel only uses indicators at last to add confluence • oi is extremely helpful health of the movetrend • funding can provide useful information but is dependent on context • vwap is brilliant indicator it incorporates price and volume a strong sr line indicators main indicators explained divergences divergence types you need to know open interest and funding how to determine if a move is healthy vwap useful indicator that incorporates price and volume indicators indicators main indicators explained indicators indicators notes • a lot of indicator are just lagging indicators eg moving average or rsi • lagging indicators are calculated from the last close price • you cannot predict what can happen next only reacting from what was already happened thus entries are given once the move has already started • lagging indicators are used for confirming a trend and its strength you can use lagging indicators eg moving averages as leading indicators by predicting that price may reject from a ma in the future but all calculations for this type of indicators needs past data before it is plotted and are only based on past data every indicator might give false signals use them with caution no lagging indicator must be used solely as a leading indicator in the sense of predicting future price they are just a representation of what happened in the past xbtusd hourly indicators bad strategy example – macd crossover quite diffuse bad strategy buying where macd blue line is crossing over the signal line red line and selling when signal line is crossing over macd usually when the cross happens the move has already started sometimes the price move back after a crossover move already started price retrace right after macd crossover move already started macd crossover can be useful to confirm and add strength to a bias of a move when a crossover happens you already missed the lion’s share the largest part of the move the same applies to moving averages deathcrosses strategy also lagging indicators indicators

with all these indicators indicators average true range atr • average true range gives the average move from a lookback period usually • atr will be higher when there is more volatility in a market • specifically useful for stocks or forex • can be used for stop loss orders or price targets eg if you place your sl inside of the atr value you are more likely to be stopped out as the price could move averagely of a atr value you can never go wrong by referring to the average true range at the start of the day there are so many ways and strategies that the atr could be used for in crypto market is less useful daniel doesn’t use atr for stop losses or targets anymore btcusd indicators average true range – example the average moving on the chart is the atr in the example is so one could trade with targets from the daily open or trade with a sl larger than the average true range for a chart and a swing trade perspective high volatility volatility is decreasing you might want to change the atr range from to days for example to get the average move on the last days just be aware of the atr when you are defining stop losses and targets but don’t use it alone daniel doesn’t use atr for stop losses or targets anymore indicators average directional index adx adx values adx can help determine how strong a trend is and in which direction it is going adx indicator comes with lines • • •

daniel doesn’t use it for signals awesome oscillator can be used on all time frames from minutes to weekly very similar to macd don’t use it alone to find divergences or topbottoms daniel doesn’t use it for buysell signals but only to determine the strength of a move btcusd min indicators awesome oscillator – example awesome oscillator is useful to spot divergences or confirmations about uptrending or downtrending moves awesome oscillator is useful if used alongside divergences daniel think it’s better than rsi for that in comparison with macd readings and points will be very similar

signals that traders are hesitating and don’t want to continue the trend anymore as a result it’s not recommended to join the trend several brown bars are a sign of a potential reversal • blue mfi increases but the volume declines a spike in price may be shortlived and precede a change in the trend blue bars appear at the times when newbies enter the trend but professional traders know that it’s already too dangerous • pink mfi is diminishing but the volume is growing also called “squat” it reflects an increase of trading interest and an active fight between buyers and sellers after one

healthy divergences divergences notes • specific divergences are seen across indicators oscillators such as macd rsi stochastic rsi obv etc • this chapter is about divergences in general without focusing on a specific indicator • use divergences as extra confluence they are the last thing daniel watch before taking a trade • people that trades only using divergences lose money after a sideway period consolidation if you get a sudden pumpdump the following move will always have bearishbullish divergences as the following wave will have less momentum this does not mean short never trade from divergences alone use them to confirm a bias that you might have for extra confluence don’t get obsessed and don’t focus only on indicators divergences bullish divergences reversal • on bullish

interest and funding open interest and funding notes open interest funding can be used to identify how “healthy” a trend or a move is is an important fee to be aware of extremely useful when trading a macro trend it can influence price can be used to identify sideway patterns or try to find how a sideway range is going to break less important than open interest but still helpful example example btc billion open interest was a level of resistance for some time funding majorly effected breakdown of the descending triangle in btc open interest is really helpful in crypto as lot of traders doesn’t have that knowledge instead in stock market more or less all traders have the same knowledge a high funding now is different than a high funding from some time ago you always need to be aware of the context open interest and funding open interest price volume open interest rising increasing increasing rising decreasing decreasing declining increasing increasing declining increasing decreasing market meaning bullish high buy interest strong uptrend new long contracts are opening bearish buy interest drying up weak uptrend existing shorts closing or being stopped out bearish high sell pressure strong downtrend new short positions are opening bullish sell pressure fading out weak downtrend existing longs are closing or being stopped out if volume and open interest are both increasing then the current price trend will probably continue in its present direction if however the volume and open interest are declining the action can be viewed as exhausted and that the current price trend may be nearing an end open interest and funding open interest • with prices moving up in an uptrend and total open interest increasing this shows that new money is coming into the market new longs which is considered bullish • if prices are rising and open interest declines the movement up is only likely to be caused by shorts covering therefore money is leaving rather than entering the market once shorts stop covering the trend is likely to reverse back down • if price is in a downtrend and open interest is rising this shows that new money is coming into the market with aggressive short selling which is considered bearish • if total open interest is declining along with declining prices this is considered bullish websites to check for open interest exocharts coinalyze tensorcharts open interest and funding funding • in crypto funding has an effect on price • perpetual swaps do not have an expiry date and they need to keep the exchange price near the spot price so when it start to reach extreme differences funding is used to make traders want to close or open positions • if funding is positive people is attracted to close their short to receive the funding longs pay shorts • if funding is negative people is attracted to close their long to receive the funding shorts pay longs with large amount of volume and higher volatility in the recent bull market funding has less impact indicators vwap useful indicator that incorporates price and volume vwap volume weighted average price vwap • vwap is a support and resistance line below the level expect resistance above the level expect support • vwap is very impactful because calculated by incorporating price and volume statistics • at vwap level there is a lot of transacted volume and it does benefit scalper that trade with bigger sizes eg institutions whales etc • really useful for scalp trades in general • can be used on all time frames from a very high time frame for swing traders to a very low time frame min for scalp traders big sizes scalps are difficult to trade when there is small volume eg in a sideway move therefore big traders prefer to trade them into a level with a lot of converging volume where the order gets most probably filled vwap can be yearly monthly weekly daily session the most used one and also ‘anchored’ btcusd – yearly vwap resistance vwap htf vwap high time frame vwap is a very strong supportresistance line when price is above vwap it is “above value” and when it is below it is “below value” position traders that are trading rarely they are not likely buy when price is above value support weekly vwap is more impactful on frequent traders it is touched more times daniel doesn’t use vwap on a really high time frame like the yearly but you can use it also for this scenario btcusd min – session vwap vwap session vwap more impactful when it is aligned with another confluence level such as fibonacci or poc resistance as vwap is based on volume statistics trading in confluence with volume levels pocs vah val is extremely powerful support when you have vwap in confluence with fibonacci levels in a trending market it becomes a very strong sr btcusd min resistance anchored vwap cyan taken from the start of an impulse down vwap anchored vwap anchored vwap could begin from a particular and specific point in time support resistance anchored vwap allows to see the average price and volume statistics from a pivotal point in time eg the coronavirus drop or the last impulse updown anchored vwap yellow taken from the start of an impulse up volume is also spiking during the impulse up volume spiking a strategy for the anchored vwap can be to select a point in time when the volume suddenly and significantly increased and maybe translating in an impulse in price as well useful tool especially for scalp traders fibonacci key notes • all fibs should always be pulled from left to right • use negative fibs fib extensions and fib expansions

bots are working on the price movements you can also add expansion levels such as etc wavesbtc fibonacci reaction at fibonacci – example in the retracement low to high or high to low you need to see reaction around to confirm that bots are working on the price movements the definitive confirmation that bots are working is when price react also to the other levels as well the retracement must not

notes • time plays a crucial role in determining which waves of a move are linked together • fibonacci time allows to estimate a correction duration given an impulse • if a correction happens too quick in comparison to the preceding impulse it’s likely to mean that is only the first part of a bigger correction and there is still more to come • fibonacci time is useful with harmonic patterns and elliot waves theory in particular corrections usually last or more with the impulse move updown eg days up – days down fibonacci time in combination with harmonics and ew theory with a nice price analysis it’s a killer feature fibonacci time can be used on any time frame but the higher the better or more you can get the right price direction but you don’t time correctly your entry you’ll

price axis y is not important for the fibonacci tool to work only time axis matters in tradingview the tool is called “trendbased fib time” start pulling from here pivot low mouse click pivot high mouse click pivot higherlow mouse click don’t trade off fibonacci time alone but use it as a confluence fibonacci time compare separate moves durations duration of the first move is transposed on the third pivot point stop pulling here for harmonics elliot wave theory and other patterns where a comparison between duration of separate moves is needed the third pivot of the fibonacci time tool can be translated in the correct position for example in harmonics the ratio of duration between ab bc and cd waves is important start pulling from here pivot low mouse click pivot high mouse click pivot higherlow mouse click fibonacci time fibonacci time on corrections start pulling from here third pivot on the next high fibonacci time can be used also for corrections in particular when a correction happens too quickly you can expect another leg down timed correctly using fibonacci time from the high to the low of the first leg down transposed with the pivot on the lower high it’s a harmonic stop pulling here pivot low mouse click pivot high mouse click expect the probable end of the correction here you can add the confluence of the fibonacci time from the initial impulse pivot higherlow mouse

first bull ran in • • the marks the end of the bear market the marks the start of the bull market the marks the end of the bull market and start of the bear market the start of the move up the end of bull market beginning of a bigger correction move • • • from this analysis it seems that bitcoin corrections are shorter than the stock market pivot low mouse click pivot high mouse click pivot higherlow mouse click btcusd daily fibonacci time fibonacci time – correction example fibonacci time from start of bear market in first low and lower high as pivot on the fibonacci time you have the end of the correction and the start of the next impulsive move expect corrections to be at least the duration of the impulse based on elliot wave theory pivot low mouse click pivot high mouse click pivot higherlow mouse click btcusd fibonacci time fibonacci time – timing a harmonic entry in shark harmonic entry timing can be predicted using fibonacci time tool in a shark harmonic the optimal relationships between ab and bc would be and for the last move up cd right direction but wrong timing for a long entry as you risk being stopped out while the price goes down better timing at extension pivot low mouse click pivot high mouse click pivot higherlow mouse click btcusd best exit from the cd move at ratio of duration of the ab move fibonacci time fibonacci time – timing a harmonic exit in shark harmonic exit timing can be predicted using fibonacci time tool to transpose the duration of the ab move in comparison to the cd move just move the pivot at c in a shark harmonic the optimal relationships between ab and cd would be cd × 𝐴𝐵 pivot low mouse click pivot high mouse click pivot higherlow mouse click fibonacci fibonacci fan fibonacci fan tool fibonacci fan fibonacci speed resistance fan notes • time plays a crucial role in determining which waves of a move are linked together • fibonacci fan are extremely useful for determining when the slope of a move has become overextended • fibonacci fan can be used to determine the time taken and the angle of a retracement fibonacci fan in confluence with fibonacci time and fibonacci retracement is really powerful in trading view it is called ‘fib speed resistance fan’ many traders forget the importance of time and angles given by geometric tools like fib time and fib fan fibonacci fan is an underappreciated tool while its extremely powerful fibonacci fan fibonacci fan values level color fibonacci fan values are the main one used in fibonacci retracements based on the fibonacci sequence with added values for quarters fibonacci fan lines based on fibonacci values are essentially the angles of the slope the most important levels are and to keep clean the chart the time values and the grid can be hidden but they can be restored when needed as they provide useful information for better time entries fibonacci fan how to use fibonacci fan tool upward stop pulling here fibonacci fan tool requires pivots like fibonacci retracement tool on the low of the move and on the high of the move in case of an upward move expect support when crossing the lines on the start pulling from here

old channel it might come into play again later • sideways channels are more respected than sloping channels • bull and bear flags regularly for channels • deviations are normal – know when to adjust them and when not • duplicating channels gives you potential target for the move • fibonacci channels are best used on htf parallel channels part parallel and sideways sloping channels parallel channels part partial declines or rises in pattern and channels parallel channels part duplicating channels trading range and over and under channel fibonacci channels part fibonacci channels fibonacci extension channels and fibonacci long term channels parallel channels parallel channels part parallel and sideways sloping channels parallel channels part parallel channels notes a deviation is when price breaks outside the channel but fails to maintain it and come back inside it a parallel channel or range is formed when there are at least touches at the bottom and at the top you will likely see the price ranging inside the channel neutral price action until the channel breaks touch touch parallel channels are a good way to remove biases on charts because you simply look for long at the bottom and short at the top of the range touch deviation a partial rise or partial decline is when price gets near the top or bottom of the channel without hitting them therefore you can think of partial rises as a sign of weakness and partial declines as a sign of strength touch do not trade your bias just trade the chart it’s given to you partial decline can be interpreted as a sign of strength breakout do not expect the range to be hit at the exact top or bottom but you will likely see deviations from the high or low and partial risesdeclines parallel channels part parallel channels – volume and breakouts coming from an established downtrend it is more probable that the channel will break on the downside touch touch volume decreasing while in the channel touch usually while price stays in a parallel channel you want to see a decline in volume like what happens on a flag a parallel channel is technically a neutral pattern as the price can break up or down but it is more probable that the channel breaks on the overall trending direction forming a structure like a flag usually when breakout occurs volume noticeably increases on the contrary during deviations the volume stays low touch volume increasing at breakout to distinguish between a deviation and the real breakout you might look at the difference in volume increased volume in channel breakout following a simple rule of continuation probabilities that channel breaks on the overall trend direction versus the opposite are vs volume volume is a key metric that you need to consider while trading channels parallel channels part parallel channels – trades deviations if correctly detected can give great entry opportunities in this case for a short once the channel is reclaimed always trade the parallel channel till it breaks when the breakout of the channel is on low volume it means it is likely to be just a deviation recognizing deviations can give a good opportunity for a trade entry once the price comes back inside the channel trading the break in the overall trend direction yields better results coming from an established downtrend it is more probable that the channel will break on the downside if you trade all the tops and bottoms of the range you must be aware that you will loose one trade at the breakout that’s why it is preferable to trade in the direction of the probable break lost trade at breakout parallel channels part parallel channels – basic targets strategy for moves and breakouts to the upside at channel top at extension of the range after hits move sl to the channel midline range added to breakout a basic channel target strategy will be long the bottom of the range short the top of the range take profit at the opposite side of the channel channel range once is hit move the stop loss at the middle line of the channel take profit can be set taking a measured move of the channel adding this distance to the breakout direction at the extension of the range range added to breakout for moves and breakouts to the downside at channel bottom at extension of the range after hits move sl to the channel midline instead of using the measured move at breakout it’s better to use horizontals fibonacci extensions or other tools to get a more accurate price target for be aware of the context the middle line can be a take profit region as well see next strategy parallel channels part parallel channels – day trading strategy max – chart if the middle line is taken move stop loss at breakeven and optionally compound the trade tp a good day trading channel target strategy will be long the bottom of the range short the top of the range take profit of profits at the middle line of the channel once is hit move stop loss at breakeven no losses optionally if the price closes above below the middle of the channel confirming it compound the trade with a smaller entry eg of the initial trade in order not to risk all profits taken strategies for day trading parallel channels are very different from strategies for swing trading parallel channels on htf if the middle line is taken move stop loss at breakeven and optionally compound the trade tp often the mid point of the channel offers a considerable resistance that’s why take profit on the midline is essential after if price retraces back to the low or top you placed your initial entry you can optionally compound your trade but it’s not suggested more than to of the profits as a partial risedecline is a sign of weakness parallel channels part parallel channels – swing trading strategy if you didn’t close the trade but only took a major part of the profits you can optionally compound the trade once the middle point is reclaimed a good swing trading channel target strategy will be tp long the bottom of the range short the top of the range take major part of the profits at the middle line of the channel you might consider to completely close the trade or take a high percentage of the profits eg if after midline tp you keep the trade open is suggested to aggressively trailing stop losses put stop loss not only at breakeven but even in profit tp in a swing trading channel the midline is a target and an aggressive take profit region trade might also be closed because the midline is a very significative resistance in a swing trading channel you might keep holding positions for days weeks months or even years depending on channel take profit at the midline of the channel as it is a high resistance compound or open a new trade btcusd daily resistance parallel channels –
